Praise for

THE Sex & Pleasure Book


“The Sex & Pleasure Book will change lives, if you let it. Whether you’re new to sex and looking to learn, seasoned in sex and looking to make things a little sexier, or a parent navigating how to talk to your child or teenager, this book is for you. Good Vibrations has been a leader in making sex better for people of all ages, genders, orientations, and bodies since its doors first opened and it continues to blaze trails with this excellent book. Highly recommended!”

—Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., Associate Professor at Indiana University and author of The Coregasm Workout and Sex Made Easy

“It is absolutely no surprise that Good Vibrations would publish the ultimate how-to, why-to, what-to book about sex. For decades, people have relied on them for products and advice that was dependable, progressive, and above all, human. I plan to recommend this book to many, many patients—the shy ones, the bold ones, and the curious ones. There’s something in here for absolutely everyone.”

—Dr. Marty Klein, Sex Therapist and author of Sexual Intelligence: What We Really Want From Sex, and How to Get It

“Good Vibrations has created an important resource guide for women’s empowerment. Yes, empowerment means having agency in all aspects of our lives from the boardroom to the bedroom. Healthy sexuality is key to our personal power. When I was a young woman, my mom didn’t have the courage to talk to me about sexuality. Luckily, she did have Our Bodies, Ourselves on the bookshelf. The Sex & Pleasure Book will be that guide for women of all ages to embrace our bodies and our passion. Pleasure is our birthright. Thank the goddess for Carol Queen and Good Vibrations!”

—Abiola Abrams, Self-Empowerment Coach, author of The Sacred Bombshell Handbook of Self-Love

“People have trusted Good Vibrations to bring them quality sex ed and orgasms for decades, and this book is a reminder why: it’s sex-positive, comprehensive, inclusive, and dedicated to demystifying all the amazing diversity of sex and sexuality. Carol Queen and Shar Rednour are the brilliant, bad ass aunts we all need to teach and advise us. Every one should own a copy of this book!”

—Tristan Taormino, Author, sex educator and director of The Expert Guide to Female Orgasms

“Good Vibrations has always been a safe and pleasure-filled space for everyone. Men feel as comfortable as women, cisgendered and transgendered alike, are included, addressed and celebrated in The Sex & Pleasure Book. Dr. Carol Queen and Shar Rednour provide smart, compassionate, thoughtful, and, importantly, practical advice to the whole person in a multitude of possible human experiences across the spectrum of passion, sexuality, relationships and even love.”

—Dr. Hernando Chaves, Doctor of Human Sexuality, Licensed CA Marriage & Family Therapist

“This is the one! An inclusive, compassionate, funny, and comprehensive guide to being a human with both a brain and genitals. If everyone, everywhere read this book, we’d probably have world peace.”

—Emily Nagoski Ph.D. in Health Behavior, Author of Come As You Are: The Surprising New Science That Will Transform Your Sex Life

Pleasure Is Your Birthright


This mantra has guided us since Good Vibrations came into being in San Francisco in 1977, at a time when sex education and community were a vital part of the city’s legendary alternative culture. Believing that we all deserve pleasure and permission to explore self-love and self-pleasure are still radical—and important—ideas and acts.

Good Vibrations was America’s first sex-positive, women-friendly store. We became a beloved institution to millions of people because the Good Vibrations difference is embedded in its history. Our founder, Joani Blank, had a master’s degree in public health; she’d worked with San Francisco Sex Information and at the pre-orgasmic women’s program at the University of California-San Francisco Medical School. From this experience she knew that selling sex toys to women required an aesthetically pleasing and comfortable environment, but it would not truly be a successful endeavor unless she could also provide information to customers about the toys themselves and using them safely, as well as about arousal and their own and their partners’ erotic anatomy. She wanted to provide all this in a setting where customers would feel safe. Thus, from the beginning, Good Vibrations specialized in providing knowledge as well as high-quality products. What she may not have foreseen was that Good Vibrations’ customers would also give us plenty of information along the way.

Almost forty years later, this book is based not only on our history of providing knowledge to our customers—though that is part of its heritage—but our perspective has also been vastly informed by decades of being told what our customers want and need. Just as we have designed toys, made movies, and written books inspired by these customer exchanges, we’ve also learned from them what we didn’t already know. Customers tell us about new ways to use the toys we sell, gaps in their sex lives, their ideas for products, their identities and communities, and their responses to the erotic books and movies we carry. They have plenty of questions for us, too, and problems they want solved. Oftentimes we have answers and solutions; when we don’t, we research the issues thoroughly. In turn, this information makes its way into our Sex Educator Sales Associates training. “SESA” is the phrase we use to describe our customer service staff; they get more informational training about sex than many medical doctors do. This perspective also influences our outreach to community experts who teach in-store classes, people in charge of further product development, and those who decide the content of our online blog. It’s our goal to be able to talk to any adult about their sex life, and we honor the trust of our customers, who tell us about their lives, desires, and sexual dilemmas. We’re grateful to all those who’ve shared information and questions. We’re inspired by the communities of erotic affiliation that surround us. Especially during the pre-Internet era of our history, our Call Center SESAs took calls from people all over the USA and the world, so we know that people everywhere have sex questions—and interesting sex lives. We’ve always prided ourselves on meeting the customer “where they are,” and in doing so we not only ask questions but also listen with a non-judgmental ear about the innermost sanctum of their private lives.

Most of us weren’t given an operating manual for our wonderful bodies and the myriad sensations we can experience with them, especially not in the “sex education” classes we took in school. Can you imagine if Driver’s Ed consisted of a teacher saying, “Here’s a car: Now don’t drive it!”? That’s the way much sex education is currently taught! Pleasure products can be purchased in all kinds of places now, but one thing most venues do not provide is trained personnel who can talk to customers comfortably and frankly, giving information about most anything related to sex toys and their use. In a world full of fabulous pleasure items, most consumers still walk into an adult-oriented store ill-prepared due to the limited sex education they received, wondering what’s most popular rather than what’s suited for them in particular. In order to achieve optimally pleasurable and healthy sex lives, it’s left to each one of us to learn what we need, toy choices included—and Good Vibrations has prioritized making that kind of information available since we first opened our doors.

When I started working at Good Vibrations in 1990 I was working on my doctorate in sexology, and I’m sure Joani Blank hired me because of that sex education focus. I attended the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, whose greatest impact on me was an introduction to the notion of “sex-positivity.” After a lifetime growing up in, and dealing with, an often sex-negative culture, it was a breath of fresh air to hear sex and sexuality described as fundamentally positive forces—at least potentially—in our lives. I took this new knowledge as a call to action, determined to help make this perspective more widely available. Negative messages can be insidious, affect us deeply, and are hard to shake. I want every single person to have access to a sex life that is right for them, with all the elements they need for it to be truly sex-positive: appropriate information and health services, understanding of and adhering to consent, healing from shame, compatible partners, communication skills to speak their truths, desires, and boundaries, and people around them who respect all of that. These are just some of the elements that would make up a sex-positive world.

That’s not the world most people live in now. But we’ve tried to assemble all these elements in this book, or at least information about them. We’ve tried to impress upon readers that each of us is unique, with varying interests and needs; to make diverse information available that is relevant to people across the sex and gender spectrum.

Speaking of which, if you are transgender you might look at some of the sections in this book and wonder if they’re relevant to you. You might notice that sometimes we use very specific language and sometimes our gender references are more general. Our primary goal is educational; with that in mind, we’ve tried to be as specific as we can, yet still be as inclusive as possible. In some chapters it will be easy for people to imagine or apply to themselves whatever we are discussing. In fact, if you can relate to a particular statement, it might have nothing to do with your gender identity but be more relevant to your age, your religious upbringing, to whom you are attracted, or any other attributes that make you the person you are.

Gender and gender identity are important—but they are not always the most significant ways that we identify or experience certain elements of sexuality. We’ve tried to strike the right balance, aware that language and ideas about identity and inclusivity are in a constant state of flux. We hope we have managed to achieve that balance, or that we’ve come close, throughout this book. We want you to know, at least, that we have not mindfully sought to exclude anyone.

Besides bringing over two decades of experience in the unique profession of Good Vibrations Staff Sexologist, I’ve tried to impart a big-picture perspective about sex and culture to these pages. “Sexology” is an academic or professional focus that can be described as “what people do sexually and how they feel about it”; it implies diversity and multiple perspectives, and carries the message that our attitudes, as well as those of our families, friends, partners and communities, color our sexual choices, feelings, and experience. Thus, while we’ve included a lot of details about specific sex acts, toys and positions—way more than overt discussion of sociocultural issues—we also include this sexological perspective, as well as Good Vibrations’ own point of view, to all the information in these pages.

There’s nothing simple about sex; I’ve found it to be an endlessly fascinating topic to explore and to learn more about all the time, and if you too are bitten by the sexology bug, we include a fabulous recommended reading list to give you a leaping-off point to explore more deeply the topics that call to and interest you.

Many staff members at Good Vibrations have helped make this book a reality over a span of many years. We’ll call some of them out in our Acknowledgements, as well as the many experts we relied upon for information. The cultural wisdom of our original home, San Francisco, is also part of what we’ve put together here—particularly the San Francisco we’ve known during impactful decades from the 1970s onward in regard to sexual freedom and diverse perspectives. I am perfectly happy to acknowledge that if I’d been a sexologist, or sold sex toys, in a place where people were afraid of their own desires, pleasures, and diversity, we’d have way less to bring you in these pages.

Wherever you live, whatever your desires, I hope you find in these pages relevant information for a more fabulous sex life. That’s what inspired this book: the hope that we can take the conversations on sexuality that occur in Good Vibrations staff trainings, on the sales floor, and in our educational programming—and in many other contexts in our unique home, the San Francisco Bay Area—and bring that to you wherever you are.

Be the Sexual Person You Want to Be!



There is nothing more characteristic of sexual response than the fact that it is not the same in any two individuals.

	—Alfred Kinsey





Just as they tell us that every snowflake is one of a kind, no two people have exactly the same sexuality. Sexuality is made up of so many components—sexual orientation, gender identity, erotic preference, physical response to stimulation, partner preferences, to name just a few important variables—that we are all precious little snowflakes. You are a sexual individual. Let that sink in. An individual. Most of the people we talk to about sexual problems or worries have gotten the message that there’s such a thing as being “normal” sexually—much fear and shame about sex comes from the notion, “Am I normal?” It may be the single most damaging concern shared by people who have not managed to feel good about and accepting of their own desires. In fact—and here’s the great news—there are many, many ways to express your sexuality naturally. And there’s no one way that everyone has to do it. Let’s hear it for freedom and pleasure!

This does not mean that every single act is OK sexually; consent is fundamental to sexual conduct, and of course some people are too young, mentally disabled, or impaired by drugs or alcohol to be able to consent; some kinds of sexual behavior, even solo, can be dangerous in action, though not in fantasy; and some can lead to unwanted and sometimes unhealthy consequences—even the most supposed “normal” sex of all, heterosexual intercourse, can result in unwanted pregnancy or STIs (sexually transmitted infections). So you learn more about safer sex, sexual safety, and consent, and how to integrate these into your life—once you learn the elements of these, they become second nature.

It’s also wise to remember that every new person you encounter erotically, if you have more than one such person in your life, is a sexual individual too—they won’t be just like the last person you were with, and you won’t be just like the last person they were with.

All this means that you have to learn who you are as a sexual person: No one has the ability or right to tell you what makes you unique; you have to determine what this means for yourself.

There are many ways to do that. You can study up on sexual options (like you’re doing by reading this book); pay attention to your fantasies, and to how you respond to erotic scenarios in books, mainstream films and TV or erotic movies; explore your body and its responses through masturbation. When you hear about something sex-related in the news, take time to consider it. How we respond to sexual stories in the culture reveals a lot about us. And it’s perfectly fine to have desires or responses different from those around you. In fact, you probably also have many similarities with them.

Next, consider how you can communicate these differences to a partner, if you have partners, and how you will learn about that person in turn. Just because you know the basics about them—gender, sexual orientation—doesn’t mean you know what they like, how they want to be touched, or the fantasies they’d like to explore. Keep in mind that it doesn’t mean they know these things about themselves yet! A common myth about sex is that if two people really love and desire each other they’ll automatically be sexually compatible, which is not necessarily true, and that good sex comes naturally when you’re with “the right person.” Some lucky people find that is true for them, but still want to prepare by knowing something about sexual techniques and safety.

But before you get to the point of sharing fantasies, introducing your favorite brand of lube, explaining which side of your clitoris is most sensitive or how hard you like to have your penis squeezed during a hand job, you have to overcome any fear and shame you may have learned at your parents’ knees, or from the bully (or your friends!) in middle school, or through bias in popular culture. If you need it, we’re here to help you throw off the shackles of that shame and be the sexual person you want to be and are—not someone else but you, the authentic you.





A Word about Our Words



“Men and others with a penis”

“Women and others with a vagina, regardless of what you call it”

“Cisgender” and “transgender”



You will see the wording above throughout this book, so we want to clarify our language.

There are many markers along the gender spectrum; some would even suggest that these markers are not along a straight line like notches on a ruler, but more comparable to the many beams of light making up the variegated colors of a wide and a curving rainbow. People on the trans spectrum include transsexual, transgender, genderqueer, female-to-male (FTM), male-to-female (MTF), and all the other terms that might fall under the broad range of trans identity, and many people fall under or relate to the umbrella term “gender-nonconforming.” We don’t usually specify trans- or cisgender in this book when we’re discussing “women” and “men.” We think that your identity is up to you—many trans people do identify simply as women and men, with no modifiers. When we do make a distinction it’s often for a precise reason. Some sections are written especially for trans folk, but most of the information in this book is relevant for people all across the gender spectrum, as well as for many differently-bodied people.

The prefix cis is sometimes used in this context: “cisgender.” It has come into use to distinguish non-transgender women and men. It means “someone who is not trans”—having a gender identity that aligns with their socially perceived gender, from that which was assigned at birth to the present. It’s not always necessary to distinguish people who are or are not cis or trans. We at Good Vibrations are part of a diverse community, including perhaps more trans customers than the average retail establishment, and we want to be inclusive of all our customers and readers. When it comes to gender we don’t believe that a “crotch test” is necessary, and as a matter of fact we know that this is generally considered rude and offensive. Journalists or the public in general need not ask someone “What’s between your legs?” That question might not be asked in so many words, but curiosity comes hidden in questions about surgery. How many surgeries an individual decides to have is relevant to their personal wishes, physical and medical concerns, and financial status. It’s irrelevant to their gender identity. Of course, in the case of this book, crotches are our business, because our customers might want something fun to put between their legs!

That brings us back to: Men—and others with a penis: What does that mean? We use this language to include pre-op—that is, pre-operative or before surgery—or non-op trans women, as well as genderqueer women who haven’t had sex reassignment surgery (or, as some now prefer to term it, realignment surgery). Women—and others with a vagina: Trans men, too, may have realignment procedures, including hormones and in some cases surgery. Trans men don’t identify with the word “woman,” but they generally still have the body part that on a cis woman would be called a vagina, though of course many FTM folks don’t use that term.



Taste in sex is like taste in food; everyone has unique likes and dislikes. And no two people match exactly when it comes to body shapes, sizes and sensitivities. We use the terms “some, many, and most” because it is inaccurate to say “all” or “none” with regard to people’s sexual preferences and practices, not to mention the way their genitals are configured or appear.





We strive to tell everyone what they might want or need to know about vaginas and other body parts even if they use different words for them. Transgender people are not all the same, and in addition to each individual having a unique bodily configuration, many use varying language to describe themselves and the sexual areas of their bodies.





You Are a Sexual Individual


Let us count the ways. Let’s start with gender. You’re a male, a female, or a transgender male or female. You’re cissexual, transsexual, or you’re intersex. Besides your actual gender, another element for most of us is where we fit on the continuum of masculinity to femininity. You’re a female, and you feel feminine. Or maybe you actually feel more masculine—not as if you’re a male in a female body, but rather—as we say in San Francisco—“butch-of-center,” or tomboyish. You can be “straight,” i.e., heterosexual, and still be butch. If you don’t feel a lot of pull one way or another on the feminine-to-masculine continuum, you might identify as “androgynous.” Or you might not even care or think about it! Some people identify as genderqueer—they don’t feel gendered in a socially normative way, even though they might not identify as transsexual.

That’s one element—what’s next? How about sexual orientation? Generally this is understood to mean the continuum of heterosexuality to bisexuality to homosexuality—straight, bi, or gay. Sexual orientation says nothing about our actual erotic preferences—what kind of sex we like to have. It only speaks to the gender of the person we might want to have sex with. Asexuality may also be a sexual orientation—it means that you don’t want to have sex with men, women, or anybody else. Asexuals do not necessarily feel no sex drive whatsoever; some asexually-identified people may masturbate, for instance—but they do not want to have partnered sex, and some people, such as sexologists and even other asexuals themselves, might reserve this term only for people who don’t experience sexual desire or want to have sex. Even these asexuals, though, might want an intimate partner—but not a partner with whom they have sex.

Speaking of partners, another way people differ is in the ways they want to have partners in their lives. Of what gender? Monogamous or non-monogamous, or even more casual than that? Polyamorous, with more than one committed partner? Married or unmarried? As we write this, not everyone can get married even if they want to do so. A partner for life, or serial monogamy? Living together or living separately?

And then there’s sex and all its elements. We’ll go into a lot of these in this book. We’re speaking here about the kind of physical sex you enjoy—so many variations abound! Solo or with another person/s—and do you like the same things in each case, or do your desires or responses change? Do you like to kiss forever? Do you hate soft touch and only like firm handling? What about BDSM (bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, sadism/masochism)? Is that your thing and, if so, are you a top, bottom, or switch? Any role-play preferences? Do you like erotic garments, and if so what kind? Adult toys, and what kind? Do you tend to be more of an initiator, or more responsive to others’ initiation?

One thing we can tell you with assurance: When we use the phrase “have sex” in this book, we are not talking solely about intercourse, or even vaginal or anal insertion with a finger or toy. There are way more kinds of sex than that, so just remember that if we’re discussing something that sounds like “just foreplay” to you, it might be another person’s primary way of enjoying their sexuality.

There are countless ways to be a sexual person, with a multitude of choices at various points; preferences; and ways to identify—not to mention elements that are seemingly set for life: all these elements inform and interact, swirling together to bring forth a blizzard of sexy snowflakes!

Not only that, but any of these elements may change or develop over time. Some tend to be foundational: as we said, seemingly set for life. It’s not as common for gender identity or sexual orientation to change as it is to discover a new practice or sensation that we like. Some aspects of sexuality are virtually guaranteed to change, at least if you live long enough: Age and life experience tend to morph the ways in which our bodies feel sensation, get aroused and come to orgasm.

Regardless of whether your desires and responses change much over time, it is possible for your identity and self-image to do so—at one point not playing an especially important role in your sexuality as a whole, at other times becoming central. The most common way to think about this is when someone with same-sex attraction or experience comes out as gay or bisexual. That’s a life-changing experience for them, one that might influence where they live, how they interact with family, who their friends are, what kind of work they do, whether they can marry the person they love. It may influence the way they have sex, too, but remember that you can mostly experience the same sexual acts with either a man or a woman partner—or a transgender or intersex partner, for that matter: kissing, touching, oral play, insertion, enjoying toys, BDSM experiences, and all the rest.

Having a particular sexual orientation doesn’t mean you have sex a certain way. And it most definitely does not mean that you should have sex a certain way! All heterosexual people don’t necessarily have intercourse. Not all gay and bisexual men have anal sex; in fact, one study showed a higher percentage of married straight women having anal intercourse than gay men, and lots of hetero men enjoy receiving anal insertion. Lesbians and bisexual women don’t all perform cunnilingus or use strap-ons. You can’t assume any of these things. The one thing that may really influence what people can do together is anatomy—you won’t be having penis/vagina intercourse if there are not people in the room with penises and vaginas. But there are still many erotic acts that any two people, regardless of gender and gender identity, can do together, if they want to do them.

Transsexual people don’t necessarily start out with the genitals they want—that is, that match their gender identity. A person born with a penis may long to be female, including genitally. A person born with a vagina and clitoris may want a body equipped with a penis and testicles instead. A trans person can go most of the way through what our society usually terms “a sex change” without altering their genitals—and some transgender people never do alter them. For other trans people, that would be unthinkable—they want their body’s characteristics and their gendered identity to match. So among trans folk, the discussion of “sexual individuality” might have one more dimension: Are their sex parts surgically or hormonally altered? If so, how does that affect function and how they feel? One trans man might have a surgically constructed penis that doesn’t carry as much erotic sensation as his brother trans man who’s had his penis—once a clitoris—enlarged through the use of testosterone; the latter guy will have similar sensation before and after hormonal treatment, perhaps—maybe even more so, if the hormones increase his sensitivity. There are variables on a trans body that mean each trans person is not the same.

But, again, no two of us are the same! Some cis women have sensitive clits and some don’t have erotic sensations from clitoral touch; cis men may have large, small, or average-sized penises; cis women may have had genital surgery or breast surgery that affects how sensitive their nipples are; cis men may have prostate or other health issues that affect whether they can get an erection.

Which leads us to another point about variability and individuality. Another range of human difference that may pertain to sexuality and a person’s sexual options is where each of us falls on the disabled-abled continuum. Within the disability community, non-disabled people are called “temporarily abled”—this phrase points out that for any of us, our sensations, physical body, and abilities might be subject to change. For some, age itself—especially the infirmities that can accompany it—sees to that. For others, disability is inborn, so perhaps should not even be called that, because for someone who didn’t become disabled, being “differently abled” is their natural state.

Each person with disabilities has different ways of interacting with sexuality—different desires, different sensations, and so forth. But a person with disabilities is often the invisible sexual individual, meaning our society tends to inaccurately represent, or even fail to acknowledge, disabled people as sexually vibrant beings.

We have a section on dis/ability which might be for you: either for yourself or for a loved one. But we’ve purposely included this information in this chapter for all readers: There’s an important, perhaps epic, point about individuality that’s been garnered specifically from research and support that’s been conducted to learn from and assist the disabled and differently abled in their sexuality, and that informs all human sexuality. This research has shown that sexual response and orgasm can be more varying and changeable than we tend to recognize—influenced by bodily difference, ability, possibly attitude or feelings, and the nervous system, as well as other yet-unknown variables. A spinal cord-injured person who cannot even feel genital touch may still get an erection, for instance. And that same person might be able to have an orgasm, but not necessarily from genital touch: rather, their sexual response cycle can be triggered through nipple play or kissing or stimulation of other nerve-rich areas on the part of the body where they retain sensation. In this chapter, on our journey to your sexual discovery, we bring these life experiences of differently-abled people to all our readers as just one more example of the awesomeness of the endless ways the human body manifests sexuality.

What do we learn from all this? That human bodies are capable of many kinds of erotic response and pathways to orgasm. When we think about “normal sex” we are actually thinking of a small fraction of what’s possible. In our variety and sexual individuality, we are actually giving each other a lot of room, and maybe even inspiration, to find the kind of pleasure that’s best for us.





How the Media Helps Us and Hurts Us


This century has brought increasingly direct references to sex and sexuality-related issues that in the past were buried in the back of the closet. In our culture sex is used to get laughs on sitcoms, to sell products, is dissected on talk shows, or steams up crime dramas and tales of fantasy kingdoms or American towns crawling with vampires and werewolves. Many analysts have criticized the media, and we too have our criticisms; however, the media is a wide, accessible landscape in which we consider sexual activities and ideas. From our point of view, the increasing visibility of sex—with representations of sex and gender difference—in mainstream media is a mostly positive development: at its best it creates deeper awareness and understanding of difference in our neighbors, loved ones, and ourselves; it makes it easier to speak openly about sexuality-related issues; and it brings vast areas of human experience out into the light of day.

That said, not all media attention is created equal! Sometimes sex and sexuality are the subject of mean-spirited punch lines, erotophobic rants, and badly stereotyped characterizations. The news is complicated; even someone in our field, much less the average person, may have feelings about fourteen-year-olds twerking in online videos, or engaging in activities like “pulling a train.” Concerns about sexism or misogyny weigh into our view of the media’s presentation of sex. Old-fashioned, incorrect assumptions go unquestioned on the editorial page, and misinformation continues to spread.

When media messages are anti-sex, homophobic, and/or overly gendered, it’s usually due to underlying cultural biases. The media created none of these: It reflects and, at most, exacerbates them. Even when we shout back at the TV, screens or devices we can thank the media for putting sexual issues out there—it allows us an opportunity to evaluate what’s wrong and to see what is beginning to change.





Throwing Off the Shackles: Fear and Shame


It’s a tall order: Just how do you throw off those shackles and become the sexual person you want to be? This doesn’t mean becoming someone else, or doing things “the right way,” but becoming yourself: your authentic sexual self. A key element to that success is overcoming or resisting fear and shame.

Many of us have received truly negative messages about all sex or some kinds of sex. We generally start receiving these messages when we’re too young and not yet consciously evolved enough to know whether they reflect reality or some kind of bias; they can start at home, at school, or in religious institutions, and are reflected in the media and by our peers. They may be enforced by name-calling, bullying, and singling out those who seem different, and by the time all this ripples out from the original sex-negative message someone heard in the first place, a web has been spun that touches practically everyone. Most often these messages are so thoroughly woven into the fabric of life that most people don’t question if it might be otherwise. Good sex education could unravel this fabric and deliver a new perspective and information that might change our feelings and experiences. Learning more about sex would allow us to optimize our experience—have really good sex, not merely sex that’s “adequate-enough-to-continue-the-species-but-not-to-rock-my-world.”

Too many people have grown up with wrong information, too little information, and/or negative attitudes. Then, on top of it all, those of us who figure out that we want more support and facts don’t know where to turn. By the time we’re old enough to have serious questions about sexuality-related issues, we are frequently too embarrassed to raise them. Sometimes we just don’t want to seem uninformed or ignorant. Other times, we’re afraid our question will lead others to judge us.

We may not have the nerve to find information or support because we’ve already internalized those judgments. We’re afraid there’s something wrong with us: with our bodies, our desires, our responses. And this interlocking set of issues is likely responsible for most of the sexual dysfunction in our society—and in our relationships and individual lives.

Mostly we don’t hear the message that there might be something wrong with the culture that, after all, started this judgmental stuff in the first place. At best, we may hear nothing at all about our desires or sexual practices—but if these are OK, why the silence? Some of us didn’t get one word of positive reinforcement or any sense that other people out there might share our interests or have the same questions. This can affect so much about us: our self-esteem, trust, the notion that we can get our desires met with a loving partner. Sometimes people turn to alcohol and drugs to deal with these feelings of shame and confusion. Others withdraw and avoid relationships; some have lots of sex, but without respect for their partners, because, after all, if they themselves are not OK, the people they have sex with aren’t OK either.

Virtually every element of sexuality can be affected by these problems. Here are just a few examples:

—Girls and women, especially, often receive the message that sex is dirty (and they should “save it for someone they love”). Any sexual curiosity or exploration leaves them vulnerable to slut-shaming and sexualized bullying. An ugly irony is that even virgins can be called sluts and subjected to bullying. Nothing about bullying is rational.

—Men are supposed to know all about sex—their own responses and their partners’—so they are embarrassed to reveal it if they know little. Without education, information about arousal and pleasure might never get through.

—Women (and sometimes men, too) may start faking orgasm, thinking they have to do this because there’s something wrong with them—or with their partner who’s unable to “make” them come.

—People of every gender have a hard time talking about sexual limits and boundaries, and are at risk for sexually transmitted conditions because it’s hard to speak up.

—Without access to positive images making it clear that people are different, with different wants and needs, it can leave some thinking they’re abnormal, even if their sexual desire—for a same-sex partner, or sex without intercourse, or anal play, or to spank their partner, or a million different things—is in fact quite common.

—Some don’t share their secrets with their partners, afraid they’ll lose out on intimacy and risk destroying a relationship if the truth comes out.

—Many feel shame about masturbation, even though it is a natural and basic sexual activity.

—Some might think their genitals or other parts of their body are ugly, unsexy, unlovable, or even deformed.




The point is that lovemaking opens up carefully guarded vulnerabilities. Indeed, the very joy of lovemaking comes from allowing frozen feelings and sensations to melt into volcanic bubblings.…

	–Marco Vassi





If fear and shame have been part of a person’s experience of sex, sexual desire, or even sexual curiosity, they can suffer the consequences in almost any area of life. And because fear and shame are so common, it’s possible that many—maybe most!—people live their lives hindered by negative messages about sex. We’ll never know how different our society would be if everyone could count on positive messages and correct information…at least not until such changes occur at a societal level. But we do know it’s possible for individual people and communities to overcome fear and shame and their toxic effects, and we know that any movement in this direction can pay big dividends for your happiness, self-esteem, health, and for your relationships too.

Some ways of dealing with fear and shame, and getting past them:

Seek out the community of others who have similar experiences or who have overcome similar problems.

Get information that helps you separate negative and biased messages from real fact.

Open up to a counselor or therapist.

Begin to talk more openly about sexuality with friends or partners.

Tune in and recognize problematic messages about sex in the media and actively search for more positive resources.

Seek to understand the ways in which sex-negative social pressure affects people: “Know thyself” is a philosophical touchstone because it can help you put things into perspective, the first step toward change.

If problematic messages have come from religious sources in your life, consider looking for spiritual communities where sex is valued in a more positive way.

If friends and family still espouse negative attitudes, draw boundaries or find new friends who don’t reinforce the negativity.

Work on self-esteem and seek to reinforce shame-free attitudes in yourself.

Become politically involved in these issues, or work/volunteer culturally in some other way to help others whose lives are also impacted by shame and fear.



From the very beginning of Good Vibrations’ history, we’ve noticed that some people come into our stores so burdened by fear and/or shame that they can’t even talk to us about what they need, want to buy, or ask questions—some can barely even say hello. Others cannot bring themselves to cross the threshold of the store. We wrote this book for them, and for you, and for every person who has ever needed support and information about sexuality, sexual health, and erotic pleasure.

It is possible to live a vibrant and healthy life filled with love, friends, and community no matter who you are as a sexual person. As long as you can express your desires with others consensually, you can live a life free of shame and fear and find support, as the person you are. Some people will need to work harder than others to get there; some have been damaged more than others by the social attitudes that give rise to fear and shame. But there are people and organizations available to help you on this journey. The result is a sex life and an intimate life you can feel good about; greater self-esteem and comfort in the world; and freedom to be the person you really are. Please let the information we’ve collected here help you on that journey.





Sex: What Is It Good For? Absolutely Everything!


Have you ever thought about this: Why do you like or want to have sex? Have you had different reasons with different partners? And when you masturbate, do you do that for different reasons than having partnered sex, or the same?

Here’s a list of reasons some people give for masturbating or having partnered sex: Do any of these statements ring true for you?

Sex feels good

Sex relieves stress

Having sex makes me feel connected to my partner

Sex makes my partner happy

I owe it to my partner

After sex I feel like saying, “Carpe Diem!” and jumping up to greet the morning

I want to make babies

Sex is a form of being in touch with the spiritual

Sex is fun for atheists

Sex puts me in a good mood

After sex I fall asleep easier

Because sex is my work or career

Sex is always new, so it’s a fun way to be adventurous together

Sex can lead to orgasm and orgasms are good for you

Sex is a form of learning about oneself and/or one’s partner

Sex is a form of teaching

Sex can be good exercise

I express my love and caring with sex





So, what about you?


Check those statements that ring true for you. Can you list other reasons from your past or present? It might be fun to do this exercise with a partner or friends.

Do negative reasons come up for you? Do the words “Someone forced me” or “They made me” come to mind? Were you looking for those on our list? Trying to squash negative or problematic feelings will not help your sex life. Addressing them will. We invite you to not let a brainstorming exercise intended to be fun cause you to feel alone, bad or bitter. We are sorry if difficult sexual experiences happened for you. We offer more on sexual trauma later in the book. Remember that people who’ve had negative sexual experiences are still able to have positive ones. We’re honored and hopeful that you have chosen to read this book.





Erasing “Am I Normal” and Substituting “Do I Desire It?”



Give your erotic identity the benefit of your admiration.

	—Susie Bright, Full Exposure





We’ve made it clear by now that you’re a sexual individual, as you are an individual in all other ways. You may be a lot like some other people—but you’re not just like anyone else. This is the bottom line of erotic diversity, and it’s one of the reasons why communication is crucial when it comes to sex.

You may have read magazine articles or heard in other ways about differences between people: men and women, gay and straight, kinky and vanilla, monogamous people and players, transgender and cisgender, the asexual and the sexed-up, and people at all levels of ability. Now replace all those ands with or. Do you think your choices are male or female? Gay or straight? Kinky or vanilla?

Some people like having their nipples touched. (Definition of people: Humans, male, female, transgender, bi-gender, intersex.) Some don’t.



While it’s fine to base some of your understanding of sex and gender on these differences, it’s problematic in at least three ways:

These binary ideas ignore the people in the middle of the spectrum. Get out your highlighter: Each of these categories is a spectrum. Ignore attitudes, articles or social pressure that presents only two main kinds of people: gay or straight, etc. Because there are so many kinds of people, trying to classify them as either/or is simplistic—these groupings will never tell you what you need to need to know about most people.

These simple definitions erase much of what makes each of us an individual.

And worst of all, these classifications can tinge attitudes with subtle or overt discrimination or bigotry.



What effect does this have on us? Well, if you rely on these either/or generalizations in hopes of better understanding someone, the generalized conclusions you reach won’t be true—they will not help you understand or get closer to this person you want to know. As a matter of fact, your attempt to get more information turns out, in a way, to leave you with less information—and that’s especially a problem if you act on your misinformed ideas and find that this person likes something very different than you thought they would.

Human beings seem to naturally gravitate towards simple ways of understanding the world. This has been particularly true in Western culture, where these binary ideas became popular. Eastern culture, by contrast, has the concept of yin and yang, with a dot of black in the white and a dot of white in the black—still binary but acknowledging, at least, that polar opposites exist within each.



It’s true that these general groupings are a start towards creating identities that make sense to us. There wouldn’t have been feminism without females, or a gay rights movement without homosexuals. These classifications are frequently the first way in which many of us establish who we are—but if they’re the only way, they can be limiting and confusing. If simple turns into simplistic, we’re all in trouble.

You can also fall into this trap when seeking to understand yourself—trying to fit yourself and your identity and desires into a box you think you’re supposed to fit, whether that definition truly matches you or not.

For example, when people who are bisexual first feel desire towards same-sex partners, they might think they’re gay or lesbian, and deal with coming out as such. They may adopt a gay identity and become active in the gay rights movement; if they still feel sexual desire towards the “opposite” sex and act on those desires, they may worry that they are “betraying the cause.” In fact, during the 1970s, many lesbian separatists accused bi women of “sleeping with the enemy.” To a binary, either/or world, bisexuality is confusing, and without acknowledgement that bisexuality exists and is natural, it can take years or even decades for someone to accept their identity as bisexual.





Opposing “Opposite Sex”!


People use this phrase all the time—it is a completely normalized part of the English language. But look at the assumptions it contains and teaches:

There are only two sexes/genders

They have nothing in common





Whether we think of this idea as describing gender roles and behavior or genitals and their shape and function, these ideas are not true. We’ll say more about genitals in our GPS for the Body chapter, but speaking of the body: Humans are overwhelmingly more alike than we are different! A heart or other organ can be transplanted from one person of any gender into another of any gender, if blood type allows, and we don’t call that evidence of the kind of fundamental dissimilarity we often reference when we talk about women and men. The idea of “opposites” tends to reinforce social roles and suggests that some people can’t or shouldn’t do certain things because of their gender; this leads to restricted opportunities, shame, bullying and baiting, and just plain sloppy thinking. In very few ways does thinking of females and males as opposite positively impact our lives, sex lives, and relationships. And thinking this way sets us up not to notice when people’s responses are actually very similar across gender lines.

Do you use this phrase a lot? Even saying “the other sex” instead—while still binary—may help you shake the tendency to add more “opposition” to our sex lives!





There are many more examples of gender complexity: the woman who wants to hide her body and may be labeled butch or asexual, but really just wants freedom from one-sided gender stereotypes; the straight man whose wife lies in front of him and he knows he “should” want to jump on top of her—but really he wants to suck on her toes. Heterosexual guys think they are not anal—until someone adds a little backdoor stimulation during a blowjob.

And then, sadly, a switch gets flipped. Many of us remain closed to experiences—sexual and otherwise—that we might have loved, out of fear that we are not “normal” if we experience and enjoy them. At worst—and we have seen a lot of this worst-case scenario—it’s possible we will worry so much about whether we properly fit the mold that our first self-reflection won’t be, “Do I want or like this?” but “Am I normal if I want or like it?” Whatever it is—dressing a certain way, exploring a certain kind of sex, being attracted to certain kinds of people—you do yourself a disservice and cut yourself off from life experience if you let a too-strict notion of identity guide your decisions.

Worrying about whether you are normal can sap your enjoyment and your self-esteem. Policing the boundaries of your own normality, and how you fit in, can leave you out of touch with who you really are—or who you could be, if you had a different set of priorities.

What if the question we all learned to ask wasn’t “Am I normal?” but rather “Do I desire it?” or “Do I enjoy it?” or even “Do I have enough information about it to try it in real life?”



What if the question we all learned to ask wasn’t “Am I normal?” but rather “Do I desire it?” or “Do I enjoy it?” or even “Do I have enough information about it to try it in real life?” That last question is perhaps especially relevant for an Internet generation that may engage in computer sex or sexting before any skin-to-skin experiences. Some people do things considered normal for others in their category just to fit in—not because they want to do them. When you’re too focused on belonging to a general group, like our misunderstood bisexual above, it’s easy to devalue or even ignore the many elements that make you who you are, that make you happy. This is especially so if you are surrounded by peer pressure or fear losing your community or family. You might find that you don’t like the things you think you should like—but feel pressure to do them anyway because that’s what people in this group do, or at least you think they do—when it’s not common to talk openly about sexual desires or experiences, it has the effect of obscuring what “normal” really is.



People of all genders have an anus. Enjoying the feeling of someone touching it does not make you gay or straight. It makes you someone with nerve endings in your anus!





How you decide to introduce yourself as a sexual person comes down to questions that have occupied philosophers for centuries. Consider, through a sexual lens, the eternal existential question: “Who am I?” If you’ve been busy trying to fit into a mold, you might not even know. Let’s look at philosophy from another angle: Instead of “I think, therefore I am,” what if the question was “I desire, therefore I am”? As far as sexual identity—your own individuality—is concerned, that is a pretty basic statement—even if your identity turns out to be far from basic!

So: How do you find the answer to this existential question?

Maybe the philosophers had it right after all: The process begins with thinking—or, more precisely, fantasizing. Be on the alert for what you respond to erotically when you read, watch movies (not just porn, but any kind of movie), and when moving around in the world. Even non-sexual situations can contain elements of sexual desire—most of us have had the experience of seeing someone on public transit or at the grocery store that we found attractive, and sexology books are full of tales of people responding with arousal to on-the-surface-unsexy experiences like getting a birthday spanking, listening to music, taking a test, even getting punished at school.

And many people first learn how their bodies respond to touch all by themselves, through masturbation, whether they started young or got into it when they were older. At Good Vibrations we say, “If you want something done right, do it yourself!” This is a proven method of understanding the kinds of sensation you enjoy.

All this adds up to the sexual version of “Know thyself.” And this is probably not a message you learned in sex ed.

We don’t really know where most specific desires come from, although theories abound, from Freud to feminism. Why does one person like women and another like men? Why are some people responsive to so-called fetishes that other people cannot see as sexual no matter how hard they try? If you have a “type,” is that hard-wired? Many scientists think that at least some elements are inborn, and some think that fetishistic desires are likely set when a person is a small child—but the fact is, these questions remain largely unexplained and mysterious. That means that many—maybe all—of us go on a journey to understand what makes us tick sexually. And it means that when we meet another person, we can’t assume the same things float their boat that float ours—though if we like them and find them attractive, we hope for enough overlap to get us into the zone of intimacy, compatibility, or at least a good time.

So: Do you even know what works best for you? Do you have erotic thoughts that appeal to you mentally, or that you respond to in fantasy, but haven’t tried? Can you talk about these, or do you try to signal your partner/s non-verbally, or just hope you’ll find someone who’ll get it—i.e., read your mind—or magically give you the experience you desire? Another cultural myth is the idea that “Someday my Prince [or Princess] will come”—in other words, that the right partner will unlock our responses and give us access to erotic pleasure and fulfillment. This notion leads us to expect that with love, good sex follows—and, conversely, that if you just had great sex, it must be love. Sexologists tell a joke: “Someday my Prince [or Princess] will come, and so will I”— to call attention to, and gently mock, this assumption that “the right one” will change everything for us sexually.

This is a compelling idea, certainly, and within it lies a grain of truth: If you fall for someone who is more sexually comfortable or confident than you are, sex with them may well be a revelation. Also, when you are very drawn to another person erotically or in the bloom of love—and, of course, it’s wonderful if and when these occur at the same time—your body may well pre-set its arousal response higher than usual, so that any contact with the beloved (or be-lust-ed) sends you right into the sexual response cycle.

If you’ve had a chance to explore erotic experiences, you may have seen for yourself how attraction can help unlock the door to arousal, or, conversely, how you can have compelling sex even with someone who isn’t your type. This latter experience is the most important reason that being able to express your desires—and know what you want in the first place—is so important.

The moment arrives for most of us when we have an opportunity to translate what we’ve thought, wondered, and fantasized about into lived experience. Maybe this has happened to you many times already, but it’s a crapshoot whether you’ll enjoy the experience as much as you could if circumstances were perfect. But do you know what that perfection would even entail? Try to break it down: the circumstances, the partner, how you communicate, the timing and touch that’s involved, everything. It’s a lot harder to optimize your sex life if you’re not sure what actually works; at least you might be able to specify what you know doesn’t work for you. Both of these, as discussed above, are important.

Let’s assume for a moment that during solo sex, this is all a lot simpler. Sure, there may be things to learn that would make masturbation better, and there may be elements of your self-pleasuring life that are problematic—perhaps shame or guilt feelings affect the experience, for example. But when you’re masturbating, you don’t have the presence of another person—a whole other complex individual with their own desires, agenda, and communication skills—to (we hope wonderfully) complicate things.

If there’s more than one person involved—you plus anybody else, whether you just met them or they’re your long-term love—you need to communicate. What do you need and want? What are your boundaries? What do they need, want, wish to avoid? And covered up by all this detail, is there an awesome sexual experience waiting for you?

Many people try to figure this out by behavior alone. They hope, or believe, that their actions will speak louder than words, and sometimes this means they have a hard time with the words themselves. Behavior is a form of communication, of course. In fact, sometimes our actions and words don’t even convey the same message. But our ability to spell out desires and limits is without a doubt a vital element in getting our needs met and creating the best possible sex and love life for ourselves.





Sex-Positivity

(The One Thing I Am NOT Open-Minded About)



By Dr. Carol Queen


Some people have never heard the phrase “sex-positive,” while others embrace it as if it were their sexual identity.

I have been using this term for over 25 years. I first heard it when I moved to San Francisco in the 1980s to earn my PhD at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. I had been doing LGBTQQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer & questioning) activist work since the mid-1970s; this included talking about homophobia. When I heard the term “sex-positive” I immediately saw how it illuminates and addresses a broader erotophobia—that is, how it is related to homophobia and other judgmental takes on sexuality. I never would’ve believed back then how widespread this phrase would become. Lately, though, I have begun to feel that in many circles it has come to be misunderstood.

What follows is the kind of sex-positivity I learned about—and when we use the term in this book and elsewhere, this is what we mean:

Sex-positivity is:

an acknowledgement that human sexuality is diverse and broad—there’s no one definition of “normal.”

non-judgmental, or at least including an awareness of, and control over, our judgments.

against shaming others about sexual and gendered matters, including—perhaps especially—children.

an acknowledgement that we have certain sexual rights, including the right to comprehensive, appropriate, pleasure-inclusive, positive sex education.

a construct that invites us to acknowledge that almost any fully consensual behavior might be right for someone, and that nothing is right for everyone.

an idea that can only be fully expressed in an atmosphere/context of consent. There is no sex-positive environment without consent. Informed, non-coercive consent. Period.

inclusive of everyone—virgins, asexuals, people who have been abused, and people who have never had pleasurable sex—sex-positivity does not describe the sex someone does or doesn’t have, it describes their attitude about sexual diversity and sexual rights. Of course, it may be a tool to open the door to a much more positive personal experience of sex—but only if it’s what someone wants.

more than anything, a way to critique our current culture—which clearly is not sex-positive. I express the critique like this: What would it take for our culture to be fully sex-positive? What are the elements that would get us there? I invite you to think about these questions—they represent a lens through which to view sexuality in a personal context and in activist work.

a notion that provides access to genuine respect for other people’s sexualities.



Sex-positivity is not:

a phrase that means “I love sex!” Though if you do—that’s great! Yay, you!

a phrase that means “I’m kinky or experimental; I’m not vanilla.” Vanilla people can be just as sex-positive as kinky people, and in fact, not all kinksters are sex-positive!

a phrase that can ever be used this way: “If you were really sex-positive, you’d have sex with me/do that kinky thing I want to try/open up our relationship/etc.”

to be used as a source of judgment or shaming of other people—including heterosexuals, asexuals, non-kinky folk, celibate people, or anyone else.

a way to judge others for not enjoying sex enough.

a new norm about what people should do in their sex lives.

a license to assume that your sexual response, experience, desires, and feelings are or should be shared by everybody else.



If anyone, no matter how sexually frisky and happy they are, tries to use the notion of sex-positivity to judge someone else’s sexual orientation, gender expression, sexual choices, or sexual response, they are not behaving in a sex-positive fashion. Period. They’re misusing the term. I cannot stress this too strongly.

When you are sex-positive, you get that you are not like everybody else, and that’s all good. As in:

I’m attracted to people who are like this, and others may be attracted to people who are like that.

I have orgasms this way, and other people have orgasms that way.

I like this sex toy and other people might not, and vice versa.

I like this kind of sex, so other people get to like their kind of sex.

I want a certain kind of relationship, and others get to want the kind of relationship that works best for them.

I respond this way to this sexual behavior or action, but other people might respond a different way.

I grew up with beliefs and experiences in a particular cultural context that affects my sexual feelings now; other people grew up within other cultural contexts.



And so on! Does it sound like “sex-positive” includes a certain “It’s not all about me” element? Yes, that too.

By the way, Good Vibrations has its own take on this issue; here’s an excerpt from the Sex-Positivity section of the goodvibes.com website:


At Good Vibrations, we believe that sexual pleasure is everyone’s birthright.

We believe that sexual pleasure is an important part of all of our lives, and that everyone should be able to live the sex life that’s right for them. We take it as our mission to respond to all forms of sexual shame and support people as they discover their authentic sexual selves.

We believe that any adult consensual sexual activity is something to affirm and celebrate. We do not judge anyone’s sexual preferences or choices, so long as those choices and activities are between adults and consented to by everyone involved or affected.

Ongoing education is essential to our mission. In order to be the best possible resource for our customers, we constantly strive to have a better understanding of sexual variation and to advance our own knowledge of sexual pleasure and desire.

To provide an environment that is supportive of our customer’s needs, we understand that our Sex Educator Sales Associates must maintain an open and respectful attitude and to model sex-positive, non-judgmental communication at all times.



So go forth and be as sex-positive as you wish! And please debunk other peoples’ misuse of this term. Too many sex people­—by which I mean people who identify on the basis of their sexual activities and who might engage in activities like BDSM, sex parties, exhibitionism, etc.—are not sex-positive enough. This term and the ideas it represents are extraordinary tools of analysis and activism, and we need to wield these tools cleanly—not mucked up with the idea that only the chosen few are sex-positive based on their behavior or orientation.





Getting What You Want



Communication


Let’s break communication down into two components: What we want to say, and how we want to say it.

The first involves all the things we cover in this book: Each specific thing you might want, like, desire, or don’t want to do is a piece of the puzzle that is you. When you communicate, you’re helping somebody understand your own individuality—your specific user’s manual. There are jillions of sex-related specifics you might want to convey to someone, though it’s your choice what to tell a person and under what circumstances. Maybe you’d rather wait until things get hot and heavy. Maybe you talk about your sexuality once you’re dating but before you get sexual. Maybe you convey important things about your sexuality right up front, to be sure you are talking to someone who’s potentially compatible. If you have an ongoing relationship with someone, you might likely say more, in greater detail, than you would during a one-night stand. On the other hand, some people find it far easier to talk in detail about sex with someone they don’t expect to see again—it’s like telling your life story to a person you meet on the train. All of these are options that might make it easier to talk to another person, but you do have to talk: a partner will not always know what you want and don’t want. They can’t read your mind. You will not get the sexual experiences you wish, and respond best to, unless you facilitate them by sharing information.

How we say it—whatever “it” is—involves several elements: timing, as in when we say it; emotions—the feelings we convey, and how it feels to talk about our sexual truth; and lastly, what we specifically say. Let’s delve into these elements now. First, the words.

Sexual terms are the building blocks of sexual communication, but not everyone feels comfortable referring to body parts and sex acts out loud. Sexual communication often stops before it starts not because someone doesn’t know what to say, but because they just can’t bring themselves to speak the words. This is a stumbling block you can overcome, and there are two main steps: (1) determine what kind of language you’re comfortable with; and (2) practice.

Are you more comfortable with scientific words than four-letter dirty talk? It’s okay to sound like a professor in bed as long as you can make yourself understood, even if you secretly wish you could swear like a sailor. If you’ve already gotten in touch with your inner pirate, the old Anglo-Saxon terms could be the words that help you speak clearly. Dirty words they may still be to many English-speakers, but words like cunt, cock, and fuck have a venerable history.



Some people find that Tantric language, with words borrowed from Sanskrit, is easier to use than the sex talk of their own culture, and others develop their own unique euphemisms. The latter is fine, as long as the person you’re talking to knows the secret code. In general, you should be able to have at least one word you favor for each relevant body part you might want to discuss, and for the sex acts as well. Maybe you have a two-tiered system: If you’re taking a walk in the park or talking over dinner, you might use terms that are less raunchy than those you’d say in bed.

So—what are your words?





The next step, if you’re nervous about using sexually-specific language in the presence of another person, is to practice. If you can’t say a word out loud to a partner or a friend, say it in the shower. Say it in the car. Say it when you’re home alone making dinner. Say it when you masturbate. Now put it in a sentence, and practice some more.

Next, figure out ways to incorporate these terms into conversations that are not loaded—in other words, when you’re just talking, not trying to communicate something important to someone. Find non-self-revealing contexts: talking with friends or acquaintances, strangers you’re chatting with at a bar, people with whom you are not sexually intimate. The news is full of sex: every time a congressman tweets a photo from his shower you have an opportunity to say “penis” and associated synonyms. People all across the country talk about these news items, and you can, too. Just think about when it is or isn’t appropriate to do so, which can be related to your safety: too much sex talk at work is often a no-no, while talking about cocks to the wrong stranger on the bus might invite, or make you appear to be, a stalker. But with your gal pals, or your after-work ballgame buddies? More than likely there are options for plenty of sex talk that isn’t sexually motivated or coded, and this helps you get comfortable so that you can up the ante with a partner.

And of course you can have these sorts of chatty conversations with your significant other too, even if you can’t bring yourself to open your mouth to ask for something specific in bed. Just keep practicing; it will get easier.

Speaking of doing it in bed: Don’t. Well, do, but first do it in a less sexually charged place. That’s where walking in the park comes in, or the dinner date, or the car trip. Ask whether it’s a good time to discuss intimate stuff. Tell your person that you’ve made a resolution to talk more comfortably about sex, and that you want their support and participation. Many partners will jump at this, and they are likely the person to whom you have the most to say. Ease into it and gauge your comfort level as you go.

Are we giving too many “baby steps” while you’re just raring to run? If you feel great about the way you’re communicating, even if you’re newly dating someone, you might not even be reading this chapter. If you have already been seeing someone, and suddenly start swearing like a late-night comedian without giving your lover a heads-up, they could rightfully be confused or judgmental. By suggesting you go step by step in revealing your interests we hope to help you avoid embarrassment or relationship tension.

There’s a sex education tool developed by Cynthia Slater that can be a big help with sexual conversations. It’s called The Three Lists, and it can help you think about your desires and limits, express your unique sexual profile, and then discuss it with others. Here’s how it works:





Yes, Maybe, and No Lists


Yes, No, and Maybe: Write these headlines across the top of a sheet of paper. Draw vertical lines to separate the three columns. Under the Yes column, write down all the things you know you like and want when you have sex, or that you are pretty sure you would want, if you ever got the chance. This should add up to a basic description of your desires.

The Maybe column includes things you want, but only under certain circumstances. It doesn’t matter what those contingencies are—it only matters that you might want to do these things, if certain conditions were met. Some examples: If you loved the person, if you really trusted them, if they used a condom, if you weren’t having your period, if you had plenty of time… there are a million possible ifs. And they’re all important, for these are the elements that help you determine whether you feel safe and comfortable about any particular activity.

Finally, the No column is just that: the place to list things you know you don’t want to do, even once for curiosity’s sake. Those are your limits and boundaries.

Ideally, you will be able to communicate the above, if the opportunity or need should arise. These are among the most important building blocks of every sexual experience, of every sex life. Even if you’re not ready to talk about all of it, you can look at this list and prioritize what’s most crucial to convey: the things you don’t want to experience, the things that make a sexual encounter pleasurable and successful for you. Perhaps later those complex Maybe items can also be put on the table.

Use this list not just as a template for sex talk, but also as a Know Thyself tool. Most of us have never been encouraged to think about our desires and limits clearly and overtly; especially if sex seems overwhelming or confusing, it can be a big help to spell it out for ourselves, and a great help—not to mention empowering—to own what we like and don’t like. Please note that you can change the list in the future if you decide some of your Maybe activities are fun all the time, or that you might be open to trying something that was on your No list—but you don’t need to think ahead about this possibility when you’re making the list for the first time. Be here now! And be honest with yourself, for this is first and foremost a tool to help you.

Here’s what you definitely do want to consider now: Some variables can make the boundaries between the Yes, No, and Maybe columns permeable: when people are drunk or high, since consent and setting firm boundaries can be an issue when people are too inebriated; when people are really turned on; and when people are in love, or highly infatuated. Maybe activities can slide into the Yes list, while No activities can become Maybe items under these circumstances. This is important to remember because it may help you understand when you’ve entered territory that can include slippery terrain, boundary-wise. Love is not a condom; being horny isn’t birth control; and if you wouldn’t want to have sex with a particular person when you’re sober, do you really want to do them drunk? Remember, know thyself!

Your Yes/No/Maybe list is a great start—but try making it again after you’ve gotten really turned on and masturbated almost to orgasm. Make another list at that point—it helps you compare your sexual self-contracts when in an altered sexual state. You might find this changes a lot; similarly, so does being inebriated.

Knowing yourself is so important because, in the end, you’re responsible for yourself and the sexual decisions you make. There is no more important person in your sex life than you. We don’t mean that if something non-consensual happens to you, you caused it. We do mean that it’s your responsibility to soberly consider what you want and don’t want, own your sexual beliefs and values, and get information that will help guide your actions. Your fantasies, arousal, and orgasms are your own, even if it sometimes seems that someone else set them off. Your sexuality is yours. And while maybe your Prince or Princess will someday come, you are not at the mercy of fate to wait for them before you can enjoy your eroticism—nor must you be at the mercy of their whims should they arrive.

That means not only that you can make the decision to pleasure yourself, and determine what your standards are when it comes to dating or hooking up, it also means you can take care of yourself—in fact, you must. You may have different ideas about what safe sex is than romantic partners or playmates do; you may need to do some work to get over shame or past bad experiences; you may need to evaluate a relationship with a clear eye and realize you’re not getting enough respect. You may need to rely on trust, not of a partner but of your parents, your best friend, your gut: If someone is telling you to have safe sex, or to speak up about your pleasure, or reveal to a partner that you hate a particular sex act—then listen to them, at least when you know they’re genuinely concerned with your welfare. You can certainly get support for all these things, but ultimately, the behavior is yours, part of your own journey.

Intimacy can give rise to profound feelings of caretaking, which can be beautiful at times, though every relationship must find its own balance of intimate connection and independence. But sometimes, people yearn for someone else to take the reins because they don’t have the confidence to do it themselves. When we’re not inclined to take responsibility, sometimes it’s because we have never been given the message that we’re capable. Low self-esteem can become entwined with romantic dreams, the urge to submit, or the feeling that fate will do with us what it will—and then it becomes harder for us to own our decisions and take responsibility for them.

Women don’t always take responsibility for their sexuality because they’re taught it’s a man’s job. Others believe, in some cases for religious or cultural reasons, that it’s a woman’s appropriate role to submit. One of our friends tells us, “I was in a threesome once with a married couple and stunned by their sex dynamics—he was really in charge, not as play, and she was so clearly the object on which he expressed his sexuality.”

By the way, when we mention submission in this context, it is not to say that all people who respond erotically to submission do so out of low self-esteem or an inability to take responsibility for themselves—far from it! See BDSM for much more on this erotic preference.





Desire + Safety = Free-Flowing Pleasure


If Desire and Safety could have a baby, its first name would be Boundless and its last name would be Pleasure!

This entire book discusses turn-ons and pleasure. Regarding turn-ons: Of course there are specific sex acts we might love (any oral sex aficionados in the house? Spanking fans?). Turn-ons can include body parts—spying a nice bulge or good cleavage, or the beautiful curve of someone’s neck. This also includes the question of who turns you on: One gender or both? Redheads or shaved heads? It might also involve some questions about context, like, “I only want a monogamous relationship” or “I like privacy—I don’t want everyone knowing my business.” If you made a thorough list of what you want in the context of sex and relationship and even added in things you’re pretty sure you’d like, if only you could try them, it might be a very long list indeed.

Turn-ons and pleasure: Pleasure, which is hopefully the result or culmination of desire, requires relaxation—in some cases we mean literal physical relaxation, as with comfortable, pleasurable anal sex, for example—and also in the sense of not having to be “on guard.” That’s what we are calling safety here. Even if you are feeling sexual tension, it’s hard to relax if you are worried—whether that’s being worried about your physical safety, being made fun of, or unwanted pregnancy. Think of the many meanings of “safety” that could be on your mind, or even in the back of your mind: pregnancy, HIV and STI prevention; avoiding non-consensual acts like abuse, attack, rape; maintaining your privacy and reputation; and emotional aspects like feeling trust—do I trust you to see me naked?, avoiding embarrassment or humiliation—will I be ridiculed if I don’t have sex like a porn star?, and our need for being treated with respect and honesty.

That’s a lot. You may not even be certain at this point what you like and what you don’t. You may still be in the process of discovery. But you likely have some idea or fantasy about what you’d like to experience and, too, some ideas about what you hope to avoid: in other words, some desires and some boundaries.

So you could boil this down to the things you want, and the things you don’t want, since if you experience things you don’t want, that can impact your ability to feel safe enough to enjoy sex at all.

There are two important ways to deal with these wants and don’t-wants in real life: You need enough information—hello, that’s why this book exists!—and you need to be able to communicate on the basis of what you know, what you want to know, what you desire, and what you don’t want to experience. Information is power—even if someone has never had a single sexual experience.

Communication is targeted power: It’s how you become an agent of your own pleasure and safety, how you negotiate for what you want, how you find out whether the person in front of you is a good match for you.

So… who are you sexually? Or who do you want to become?





So Many Kinds of Safe Sex


Sexual safety means many different things: barriers or not, contraceptive decisions, avoiding—or recovering from—abuse and sexual violence, and expressing your sexuality in an interpersonal context where you feel respected, valued, and safe. There’s no one definition of a healthy relationship, whether it’s life-long or brief. To be safe, in the context we’re discussing here, all parties ought to feel safe enough to be themselves, feel secure within the parameters of the relationship, whatever those are, communicate clearly, give consent, and be free from shaming and humiliation around one’s sexual desires, body, and abilities.

Then there’s old-school safe sex: Latex and lube, condoms and gloves. This is another facet of being a sexually active person that requires decision-making, information-gathering, and communication of boundaries: that is, taking responsibility.

It’s worth noting that having fewer partners—even being monogamous—isn’t an effective strategy unless the sex is safe, and/or the partner/s don’t have STIs in the first place. Many a monogamous partner has gotten a sexually transmitted disease in spite of their “one and only” choice; of course, when people are uninfected and mutually monogamous, risk is somewhere between very low to zero. Needless to say, both partners must be actually monogamous, not in name only, for this to be true.

There are three main pieces to constructing a safer sex lifestyle. The first is keeping up with sexual health information just as you would other kinds of health and wellness issues such as diet and exercise. Science is constantly evolving, and information changes quite often. As a result, different STIs command the public’s attention at different times. In the 1970s it was herpes; in the 1980s and ’90s, HIV/AIDS; in the 2000s much more has been learned and reported about HPV, the Human Papillomavirus. These are just a few examples of bugs that hitchhike on our bodies via our genitals. So even if you were shown some scary pictures in high school of genitals affected by syphilis, there are still updates to be considered—what’s the rate of syphilis in the population now? Is there a lot of it where you are, or where you’re planning to travel and get frisky? How are antibiotics handling new strains of this disease? For example, at this writing some types of gonorrhea have become resistant to antibiotics, but we have little doubt that could be old news by tomorrow. That’s the point.

To stay up to date as sex educators, we check in with the Centers for Disease Control and other resources to obtain recent information. We don’t rely on Internet crowd-sourced pages; however, we check in on these to see what people are saying. Some doctors know a great deal about the latest STI-related info, and some just don’t. The media can be seduced by factoids and statistics. The Internet is chock-full of information; some of it is securely grounded in research, and some is completely unreliable. The bottom line? The more informed we are in the first place, the better we will be able to evaluate each new bit of information that comes our way.

The next step is determining what all this means for you. Every sexually transmitted condition, including pregnancy, is relevant to some of us; how relevant are these to you? If you don’t have sex with other people, not much. Other than that, you need to consider the kinds of sex you’ve had and are likely to have in the future; how barrier-protected it’s been and will likely continue to be; how many partners you’ve had, have now and/or may have in the future; who your sexual partner/s are (i.e., have they likely been exposed to STIs or not); and whether there are factors in your life that make it difficult for you to know or have control over who you have sex with, or whether that sex is safe. These can include substance use issues, some sex work contexts, or whether all the sex you have or have had is consensual.

Harm reduction suggests that you can reduce your risk of unwanted pregnancy and STIs by:

Having fewer sexual partners

OR having sex with people less likely to be exposed to STIs

OR having the kinds of sex less likely to result in STI transmission and/or pregnancy

OR having informed safer sex standards and sticking to them.

More detail about STIs can be found here.

Finally—in order to have safer sex, you have to communicate, verbally or by your behavior, that you expect it. Some people succeed in whipping out condoms and other barriers without saying a word, because they have made it clear that the condom/glove/etc. will be used, or no sex will be had. Others prefer to discuss the issue before the bedroom door opens.

We subscribe to the notion of “the most conservative partner rules”: That’s shorthand for “lovers agree to have sex that meets the standards or needs of the partner with the most conservative safer sex boundaries.” Here’s an example: Terry Doe thinks that condoms are necessary for intercourse and blowjobs but Terry’s lover, Sasha, thinks that condoms are only necessary for intercourse. Terry and Sasha use condoms for blowjobs because Terry, the most conservative partner in the scenario, gets to set the standard—there’s no physical “compromise” that makes Terry worry about safety to please Sasha. This couple could talk about it, argue about it even, but until/unless they both agree to blowjobs without condoms, they agree to the “safer” person’s wishes—the one with the more restrictive rules. This way no one’s feelings of safety or comfort are impaired and all sex is consensual, even though the less conservative partner may need to rubber up for acts they wouldn’t have otherwise. The bottom line is: Both/all partners deserve to be able to engage in the sex that feels safe to them. And guess what, less conservative partner—when your lover feels safe and taken care of, they enjoy sex more! That’s great for everyone.

This way of thinking and making decisions or setting boundaries can be relevant for more than condoms—apply it to any kind of sexual decisions: safer play, BDSM negotiations, emotional safety, and anything else that might come up. Does this mean that some people won’t get what they want in the moment? Yes, potentially. The “most conservative partner” discussion is central to people’s ability to determine how sexually compatible they are.





Safer Sex = Barrier Method


Now we’re going to spell it out: What is safer sex?

To successfully use barrier methods to avoid most STIs—and prevent pregnancy, too—you need to get familiar and comfortable with condoms, lubricants, gloves, and dental dams or plastic wrap. You also must consider how most STIs can be passed between sexual partners: this process often involves body fluids, skin rubbing on skin, and/or coming in contact with blood. Since some pathogens can transmit skin-to-skin, it’s hard to completely avoid them. Still, if you put a barrier between genitals during sex, you are going a long way toward staying safe—or at least safer.



Condoms: If your sex acts of choice involve a penis and any other orifice—or even genital rubbing without insertion—stock up on condoms. These are good for using on dildos and insertable vibrators, too. Most condoms are made of latex, though some people are sensitive to this material, which means you might prefer hypoallergenic condoms or ones made of polyurethane or polyisoprene. Condoms are much more comfortable and functional when used with lubricant. For the wearer’s comfort and sexual sensitivity, put a few drops of lube into the condom before you roll it onto the penis—if you’re putting it on a toy, it won’t care about this step—which will both allow the pleasurable sensations to be felt more acutely, but also help prevent an air bubble in the tip. Pinch the head as you roll it on so no air bubble is left at the end. You have to use a condom from the first moment a penis contacts another body, since pre-ejaculate may transfer STI microbes—and sperm. Make sure the condom doesn’t come off during intercourse, and tie it off when you’re finished to discard it in the trash, not in a toilet…unless you think your plumber is a hottie, but that’s rather nonconsensual.

Most condoms are roughly the same size, but people at the smaller and larger end of the size scale may wish to shop around and look for the best fit. If you are a good deal wider at the base, a condom might not stay on the penis without trying to roll back up; a cock ring might keep it stable. Some condoms have especially large heads, and these are more comfortable for many wearers. This type could move on the head of the penis which can feel more erotic to the wearer than a tight condom would.

“Female” or Insertive Condoms: These do not fit onto a penis, but into a vagina or anus. For those who don’t like the way traditional condoms fit, or have other problems with them, this is an option (as long as the receiver, the wearer, agrees). The wearer sometimes feels empowered that now they have control over the safe sex instead of depending on someone else to wear a condom. These insertive condoms also might increase penile sensation in an enjoyable way. They can be put in before intercourse starts; they can be used vaginally or anally, but we always recommend that you hold onto them when using them for anal intercourse so they can’t be pushed all the way inside. Beware, too, thrusting in beside the condom rather than into it.

Gloves: These are the favored safer sex gear for those in the know partly because they make manual sex play so much more comfortable. Gloves cover up rough skin and hangnails and make finger or hand insertion smooth. They not only protect the genitals from any unwanted hitchhikers on the hands; they also protect the hands from any STI organisms present on the genitals, and if sex play involves going from anus to vagina, using a separate glove for each orifice will lower the chance that some form of bacterial vaginosis will occur.

Dental Dams: These are squares of latex that act as barriers between oral-genital or oral-anal play. The dam sits against the vulva or anus and you lick it; the dam is so thin that the sensation transfers through, especially if you put lubricant on the vulva/anus side. Watch out for dropping these and beginning to lick the opposite side! Some people affix these into crotchless panties or garter belts to make them easier to handle. Other simply use plastic wrap.

Plastic Wrap: Some find plastic wrap an improvement over dams for a few reasons: It is clear, and you can more easily see where you’re aiming your tongue; you can tear a much larger sheet of it off the roll, even long enough to wrap around the whole genital area, which keeps the plastic from sliding away; and it clings to the skin better than latex does. Some people have heard that microwaveable plastic wrap isn’t safe to use as a barrier method because it has larger pores than the regular kind; the worry is that this will let HIV or other microbes through. Those pores don’t open up until the temperature gets quite high. If you can raise your lover’s temperature to 140 degrees, wow! If not, don’t worry about using the microwaveable wrap.

Finger Cots: These are like single fingers from a rubber glove, or very small condoms. Perhaps they will fit some people with small phalluses, and they can be great covers for small sex toys that would be engulfed in a regular condom. But if you want to use them to cover a finger, ask yourself: Is it possible your partner will ask you to go up to two fingers this time?





LITERALLY Introducing Yourself As a Sexual Being


Have you noticed that, even in the 21st century, advice columnists rarely or never weigh in as to when you ought to tell your girlfriend you want to wear her panties, or speak up about that unique fetish that is as much a part of you as the freckles on your arms? First date? Fifth date? What if you’re not dating at all?

If you are having a one-nighter with someone and your sex specialty isn’t on the menu, you may not feel the need to talk it up. We don’t wear name tags with our sexual proclivities written out, after all; sometimes we just don’t mention them. Maybe it seems too soon to declare your love of spanking or whatever your favorite fetish may be right off the bat, or your new friend doesn’t seem like the sort who’d like it. Or maybe your time together just flows, and sexy spanking becomes part of the play seamlessly and positively—in this case, actions speak louder than words! But if you think you’re going to have sex with this person again, or maybe again and again, that might mean you’re on a path to greater intimacy—maybe not going steady or becoming life partners, but at least becoming “fuck buddies” or “friends-with-benefits.” In any ongoing connection, compatibility and communication matter. Your love of spanking might become a more important detail in hook-ups to come. That’s a reason to talk about it right up front.

We did wear nametags like this at San Francisco Sex Information—these included both our names and our sexual identities and interests, and sometimes those tags were too small for the adventurous among us! So here’s a fun bit of homework: Write down everything that would be listed on such a tag if you were to wear one. You are one-of-a-kind, remember? These are all the sexual wishes or practices that come in the package that is you. And if you’re going to be in a sexual relationship with someone, you bring that whole package along. Maybe you don’t unwrap it all at once; maybe there are some parts you never share. But if you have an ongoing connection, the person deserves to know anything relevant, and if you get really intimate, unless they agree not to know all of who you are, try to create an open and honest agreement with each other. This protects both of you from the drama of the Big Long-Overdue Reveal: She catches you wearing her panties; he sees your browser history with all those visits to spanking sites and freaks out; that ex-lover really isn’t all-the-way-ex. Or it turns out that the other person doesn’t like spanking, or panties, or whatever it is that is a part of you: What a terrible and painful situation that could be for both of you! That might not just trigger a divorce—it might be a bad divorce.

If you’re lucky enough, and comfortable enough with yourself, to live in a world where you can communicate easily about sexual issues, come out early! If you are already known as the guy who’s into BDSM, the woman who likes variety in her sexual partners, the one who counsels everybody else about safer sex, all you have to do is confirm the rumors and add the relevant details to your personal sexual profile. If you can talk about your general identity, do it—besides giving some useful info about you, you will also be making it easier for others to communicate by your example, and raising other people’s information level about sexual diversity. Your circumstances may dictate more privacy than this, but even so, speak up if you begin feeling that you and someone you’re seeing are becoming ongoingly important to each other, regardless of how you define your relationship status. Even if you sign up as “single” or “it’s complicated,” if you are motivated to keep this person in your life, you may already be a few steps past time for The Talk. Something like:

“I enjoy our time together so much! I want to make sure you and I are on the same page with our understanding about who we are. It hasn’t come up yet, but I want you to know that I’m also interested in [sex acts A-Z]. If you’re interested in any of that, maybe we could add it to the fun we already have—if not, maybe I can answer any questions you have about it and tell you why it’s part of my sexuality.” Put it out there with dignity—it’s you, there’s no need to feel ashamed about anything that’s consensual—and make it clear that this is done so that you can trust and understand each other on a deeper level.

Note that this could turn into a relationship definition talk—that might be a good idea, or you might want to separate the two topics. If that’s the case, specifically say that you can talk about that issue another time, that you just want to be clear about sexual and personal compatibility. The relationship definition thing is part of this too—you can be 100% compatible in the sack and still have relationship deal-breakers.

As always, remember that it’s rude to just talk about yourself! Make sure the other person has the opportunity to introduce themselves back to you, sexually speaking.





Your Safer Sex Elevator Speech


Our colleague Reid Mihalko has a useful tactic for talking about safety and risk reduction: the Safer Sex Elevator Speech.

An elevator speech takes your long, drawn-out thoughts and plans about a project or issue and boils them down into a few succinct sentences that you could literally tell someone if you cornered them on an elevator. Between the first and fourth floors, you should be able to state your purpose and get someone’s attention.

How do you calmly and clearly tell someone you just met and are attracted to that it’d be a good idea to stock up on the prophylactics? Of course, you could be that person—it’s not necessarily their job to do it. But having the right gear at both your houses couldn’t hurt. One sample way to say it—customize the tone and the specifics based on your own needs:

“I don’t want to have to worry about STIs when I’m sexually intimate with another person, because I want to just enjoy the experience and feel the feelings. Being safe lets me do that. I just get to have fun. So I want to use condoms for any insertive sex and barriers for oral.”

Here are some tips to help you think about what your personal speech should include, and how and when to bring it up:

Talking about this will make more sense if you’re already talking about sex together—even if it’s just light flirting or “sex in the news” type discussion.

You can in fact create an opening by steering the conversation to sex, to STIs, to unwanted pregnancy. These are all social issues that pretty much anyone might discuss.

If it’s already clear you might have sex with this person, you could reference that—and if that’s not on the table yet, you can keep your statements more general.

Know what your safer sex boundaries are! By its very nature an elevator speech must be ready to go: between the third and fourth floor is no time to re-think the main points.

Make it matter-of-fact, not fraught with melodrama. Remember, you are allowed to set any limits that make sense to you.

Don’t be embarrassed or sheepish about setting these limits. If you present the issue without confidence, it’ll make it easier for the other person to quibble with what you say.

You might want to have a few facts or statistics in your pocket in case the other person does argue. But more importantly, ask yourself: Why go further with a person who argues about the basic precautions that make you feel safe and comfortable having sex? Really, is that a good sign? No, it isn’t.

You might want to explain the Most Conservative Person Rule.

To avoid appearing by your statement that it means you don’t think they’re personally safe, you can say that your safer sex policy allows you not to have to wonder about anybody: It’s not them, these are your requirements for sex. It’s about your own comfort level, implying no judgment about them at all.

All this will seem much more intense if you start talking after your pants are off, so it’s best to initiate this conversation before you get to that point!

Having safer sexy sex is a skill, and a fun one to acquire! If you feel like you’ve got it down, brag on yourself a little. “Oh, you won’t believe how good it can be!” If you’re not so experienced or if talking yourself up isn’t your style, tell them you need more practice, and you really want to practice with them.





Dumping The “Who Is” & “Who Isn’t”


Everyone Has HIV. Well, of course that’s ridiculous—everyone does not have HIV! Why would we say that?

When the HIV epidemic was taking hold in San Francisco, it was naturally a priority to teach everyone about AIDS and how to prevent it, including very explicit discussions about safer sex. This frank and sex-inclusive strategy came to be called the San Francisco Model of HIV education. The most difficult issue was not, in fact, addressing how to use a condom or even encouraging people to master the skill of rocking those under-utilized scraps of latex called dental dams. Instead, the question was How to determine who had HIV, and thus with whom you’d have to play safe, or even avoid sex altogether. Some people advocated for all HIV-positive people to have sex only with each other—but that still begged the question of who had the virus to begin with. And in the early days of the epidemic HIV was very much thought of as a fatal condition, so not only did these decisions matter deeply to a frightened populace, they also led to a concerning degree of labeling and discrimination against people who might have HIV.

So the San Francisco Model developed a strategy to try to head off this “who is, who isn’t” situation: Rather than try to figure out if a potential lover looked like they might be HIV-infected (if you think this sounds like a good strategy, sorry: You can’t tell) or ask them whether they had HIV—and then trust that they knew the answer to that question—instead, the strategy was simple. Just behave as though everyone you met and got intimate with was HIV-positive. Carry condoms and “wrap that rascal!” before any insertive sex; glove up for finger play; use dental dams or plastic wrap as a barrier for cunnilingus and rimming. Or stick with sexy, sensual outercourse: “On me, not in me” meant external ejaculation only, and suddenly kinks like voyeurism, phone sex, and rubber fetishism were safer sex options.

Behaving as though everyone might be HIV-positive meant everyone was in it together; it supported community feeling and support and tended to discourage the scapegoating or separation of people who did have HIV/AIDS. Instead of worrying how many partners your new partner’s partner might have had, people were encouraged to play safely.

Even today, with all the changes that have occurred over the course of the HIV epidemic, this is wise advice. There’s no cure yet for HIV. People do still die from it, or find the side effects of antiviral drugs to be very difficult to live with. Even more important, people are at least as likely today as they were in the mid-1980s to think that HIV is someone else’s problem. We don’t agree with this; we believe we’re all in this together, but even so, the notion that “people like us” (or like you) don’t get HIV makes it hard to protect ourselves, because that’s just misinformed. Like every other STI, HIV rides along on warm human bodies and in the bloodstream; it doesn’t care who you are.

Regardless of HIV, the odds that you’ll get close to herpes, chlamydia, or HPV are pretty high. Thinking that “Everyone has a sexually transmitted condition” is still a pretty savvy way to prevent yourself from being one of them.





No Matter Who You Are, There’s a Safer Sex for You


One of the biggest challenges when it comes to thinking about safer sex is our diversity, both sexually and culturally. On the one hand, all humans who have sex might possibly come in contact with sexually transmitted infections. Those bugs are just looking for places to hitch a ride, that’s all, and they don’t judge—even if humans sometimes do. On the other hand, depending on who we are and how we have sex, some of us might surely come in closer or more frequent contact with those microbes than others.

It’s not who you are; it’s what you do sexually, and with whom you do it, that might elevate your risk. This means that no one should ever assume that they’re not at risk just because they’re heterosexual, or lesbian, or retired, or still in high school, or married, or of any other identity.

Still, identities matter, maybe not primarily because of behavior, but because different people might respond best to different kinds of education. If you’re a young African-American man in Oakland who just got out of high school and is hitting the dating scene, you might not feel the safer sex message geared to Marin County heterosexual divorceés is very relevant to you! We don’t have enough space in this book to fine-tune our message of support to people of many varying identities, but we will tell you that you deserve information that is culturally competent: that is, that uses language and scenarios that make sense to you and that helps you realistically decide what your safety and prevention decisions need to be.





When You Know You Have an STI


Let’s begin by reminding ourselves that unless we have never ever had sex, or have a battery of STI tests very frequently, many of us have an STI, or two or three, and don’t even know it. Sexually transmitted infections are like any other kind of contagious bug—they simply take advantage of environmental conditions to make the rounds. The difference between an STI germ and the common cold is that one microorganism has a cushy pathway on nice warm genitals, and the other has to stay alive on a doorknob until its next host comes along. There’s nothing especially delightful about opening a door—maybe in a different kind of world, getting an STI would be seen as a badge that we’d had a good time, nothing more.

But in this world, many people consider it a big deal to get an STI, or to have sex with or even meet someone who has one. There is an undercurrent of sexual shame to this. True, some STIs are serious business, and it’s pretty much better to prevent them than to get them! But these are also some seriously common bugs, and many people have had an STI—not just people who have “too much” sex, however much that is, who have multiple partners, or any of the other nasty attitudes that can accompany our fear of sexually transmitted infections.

The other thing that people find concerning is the idea that they might give an STI to someone else, and/or that they need to communicate about their status and don’t know how.

We just shared the Elevator Speech with you, and if you know you have an STI, the template is still the same. Whether you want to go into detail about your history—“and then when we broke up, I found I’d caught his herpes…”—or you just matter-of-factly state, “I went to the doctor and they told me I had <fill-in-the-blank>,” you are still negotiating safety, and that’s what matters.

That you have an STI does not say anything about what kind of person you are. STI germs don’t evaluate morals or character before they take a ride on genitals; they just do what they do to stay alive. It is not appropriate for someone to try to shame you for having an STI, although it is their right to state their own safer sex needs, as in the Most Conservative Person Rule, and in fact it’s their right to decide not to have sex. Especially if you’re new to speaking to potential partners about this aspect of your life, it can hurt to be rejected—but remember, there’s always a chance someone we’re sexually interested in could reject us! Encouraging your reluctant partner to get more information about safer sex is appropriate, and it might even be within bounds to remind them that it’s ironic if they’re more upset about your STI than worried about sleeping with someone whose status they don’t know. Do not allow them to shame you: If they haven’t been tested recently, they may have an STI too! And keep an eye out for people who put STI status in perspective and are comfortable with safer sex. That’s one less thing to worry about!





If a Past Partner Had an STI


You may have dealt with STIs with a past partner and found that it was relatively easy to do. When people know their status, are honest, communicate well, and negotiate acceptable safer sex rules, being a “discordant couple”—one with an STI, one without—might not be a great problem. If you’ve successfully had such a relationship, you can use that experience to talk to potential new partners about safety and your own comfort level, take into consideration though that this may involve “outing” your ex and their STI status.





Pass the Lubricant!


Lubricants are a quick and inexpensive way to enhance and improve your sex life. Lube makes condoms more effective. Lubricants are a must for making anal sex safer and more pleasurable. It’s easier and safer to start with lube than it is to get into a sexual situation that becomes painful, unsafe or simply doesn’t work (as when penis, dildo or finger insertion is unsuccessful because there’s too much friction). After all, if you use too much you can always use less next time—or you can wipe some off and keep on going, but if you don’t have enough to begin with, you might not be able to go at it at all.

Many people think that arousal makes the vagina wet enough for sexual intercourse. That’s simply not true for many people—but no problem, lubricants are here to help. And lube is always a must for anal.





Did You Know?


Arousal level doesn’t necessarily match someone’s degree of vaginal lubrication. Changes in hormone levels, pregnancy, and menopause can alter levels of wetness. So do many prescription and over-the-counter medications, not to mention “social drugs” like alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana.





Types of Lubricants


Cherry flavored, Vanilla-Mint, self-heating, warm and tingly when you breathe on them… and even cinnamon sticks! Do you ever think you should serve lube on the dessert bar instead of in the bedroom?

Let us break down the menu:





Water-based


These lubricants are usually fairly thin, and many do a pretty good job of mimicking the feel of vaginal lubrication. Great for vaginal intercourse and manual play, especially on the vulva. As for penis-centered hand jobs, water-based lube dries out rather quickly when exposed to air. Safe with latex and toys.





Water-based Gel


These are much like the above, but thicker. They get slippery during play, so if you use them for vaginal sex they won’t feel too viscous—but they may be even better for anal insertion, where their extra thickness can help cushion things a bit. You can re-wet gels with a sprinkle of water or your saliva. Safe with latex and toys.





Water-based Cream


Cream lubricant looks and feels like lotion, so it allows for more friction—great for hand jobs, and many people like it for vaginal intercourse. These lubes may last longer than the other water-based products, though they have a tendency to be absorbed by the skin in a lotion-like way. They may not be best to use before oral sex, as some brands have a flavor that is not neutral and some people do not like the taste. This does vary from brand to brand, though, so if you like a cream lube for other sex acts, give it a lick and see what you think. Safe with latex and toys, with this caveat—as we will note in more detail below, silicone is present in many cream lubricants, and some silicone lubes and toys are not compatible with each other. Most cream lubricants contain only small amounts of silicone, but this varies (as does the quality of silicone toys), so we recommend that you do a patch test on your toy’s base to make sure your chosen lubricant works with it.

Note about water-based lubricants: Almost all of them have a preservative, and some people find they are sensitive to that or other lube ingredients. Some people choose organic lubricants and some folks have told us they simply go for the lube with the fewest number of ingredients. The bottom line is, if you find that a lubricant has an uncomfortable feel, makes you itchy or causes some other reaction that suggests you have an intolerance to it—switch to something else! These products are supposed to make sex more comfortable, not less.





Silicone


This is extremely slick, usually fairly thin, and many people like it for vaginal, anal, and manual play. Its plus and its minus is that it stays and stays—which means it can be more difficult to wash away than water-based products. That can be annoying after sex if you’re wiping and washing, wiping and washing, and it still won’t go away. On the other hand, some love this feeling on their genitals after sex—everything is smooth and slick. It can feel luxurious and moisturizing. And of course if you want to have rub-a-dub sex in water, the staying power of silicone is perfect. As said above, follow warnings about using silicone lube with silicone toys. Try it on a small part of the toy (like the base of the dildo) before slathering up the whole thing. Be careful to do this, because if incompatible with the lube, the toy becomes tacky and gets an odd bumpy surface; it will never return to its prior texture again, no matter how much you wash it. These lubricants are safe to use with condoms and all latex.





Hybrid Lubricant


Roses, cars and now even lubricants can be “hybrids.” What does that mean? Simply that it is a mix, in this case of a silicone and a water-based lubricant. Some cream lubricants are, in fact, hybrids, because silicone is one of their ingredients. These are used for vaginal, anal and manual sex. Again, consider whether or not to use these lubes on toys—use a tiny sample area before the big slather. Usually, if a manufacturer’s silicone products do not work with any silicone lubricants they will include this information in their user booklets. If it isn’t specifically mentioned we recommend only using water-based lubricants or testing out the sample area. Better safe than sorry. Hybrids are condom- and latex-safe.





Oil-based


Not recommended for most people for vaginal intercourse, although we’ve spoken to some who like coconut oil or shea butter oil for this purpose. Never use mineral oil-based products such as Vaseline, baby oil, Albolene, etc. for insertive sex—they dry the mucosa, the wet tissues of vagina and anus. Remember, oils and oil-based lubes are never safe with latex condoms. If a person chooses to use a vegetable or nut oil for insertion and needs a condom, a non-latex (poly/plastic) type can be used. Vegetable and nut oils, if you are not allergic to the product they derive from, can be used for hand jobs and sensual massage. Some people like them for anal sex, especially products like vegetable shortening—the kind you’d use in pie crust—which are thicker and “cushier.” Remember that if you are having any type of sex using a latex condom, dam, or gloves, oil-based lubes are not for you.

Some cottage businesses offer wonderful emollient oils and lubricants helpful for people who don’t need condoms and are sensitive to other lubes. Also some people love using sensual massage bars, candles and oils.





Saliva


Almost always available, saliva can be applied liberally or in small amounts as wanted or needed.





Glycerine a.k.a. Glycerin or Glycerol


Glycerin is chemically related to sugar, and it does not seem to agree with everyone’s vaginal flora—for some, it seems to irritate, or to encourage yeast infections. Others use it without problems. There are enough people who have reactions, though, that many water-based lubes today have stopped including glycerine. Silicone and oil-based preparations generally don’t include it.





Extras on the Menu


The varieties of specialty lubricants listed below are often given out at bachelor parties, as part of a Valentine’s Day gift basket, or when couples are trying “to spice things up a little.” When buying any novelty lubes, check the dates to be sure they aren’t expired, stick with samples or smaller sizes unless you already know you like the brand, and remember we do not recommend using them internally. Keep your regular lube at the ready—flavored or warming lubes are not replacements. Rather, they’re a fun way to spark experimenting and conversation: “Did you like that?” or “Did it work? Can you feel it?” They are also good for bringing attention to a body part that you might want to get noticed. Are you wanting your nipples licked more? Need your toes heated? Want to pretend your lover is a lollypop? Here you go!





Flavored


Many people enjoy these for oral sex, and they’re a great way to get the conversation and/or action going downtown. Here’s the insider scoop: In the past we strongly recommended not using these for inserting anything in the vagina or anus because of the chemical mix which would come in contact with mucous membranes. But some quality brands of flavored lubricants are recommended for all types of use. Some companies make flavored lubricants without sugar, using small amounts of aspartame or another substitute, so vaginal irritation isn’t a potential problem, as it sometimes is with a sugary lubricant. If you want to experiment with a flavored lubricant, make sure you like the taste, but if you’re going to insert it, try a small amount first to make sure there’s no reaction. Ask which brands are for the outside of the body and which are safe for the inside. Our main reservation about this kind of product is a user’s potential sensitivity to ingredients. This is especially true if you are allergic to the flavor in question when it’s in food: Do strawberries give you hives? Watch out for strawberry-flavored lubes. Of course, some flavoring agents are completely artificial and have no relationship to any actual strawberry!





Heating


These frequently use an extra big dose of glycerin to achieve the advertised effect (see our callout above for more on that ingredient). Again, they’re not recommended for insertion as much as for external vulva/penile use, and some people don’t tolerate glycerin well when it’s rubbed onto mucosal tissues. Some people like the sensation these warming lubes give the clitoris, penis, nipples or other areas; others don’t. We always recommend starting with a tiny amount and then once you gauge the intensity of that particular product, you can add more if desired. These work best with friction (like hand jobs) or by amplifying the warmth of one’s breath. That’s breath as in heavy breathing, not blowing. Blowing often cools them down instead of heating them up. You might want to be cautious about how much of these products you actually ingest! Some natural heating lubricants use menthol for minty goodness and sensory play.





Extra sensation


These are often not really lubricants—they are sensation creams or gels. If you are curious about these, please try them on a small area first to see if they are right for you. We have some cautions here that everyone should read in case any apply to you. The instructions on these frequently tell you to apply to the clitoris and rub in for a few minutes, which will result in arousal. Here’s the insider scoop—actually more of an open secret—you can do that with ANY slippery liquid—regular lubricant, coconut oil, or your own saliva—and achieve arousal! Save your money, at least until you have tried that simple tactic first.

Some of these products contain the amino acid L-arginine, which encourages blood flow just like rubbing with a lubricant does. Unlike lube, however, these creams might be problematic for users who have herpes. Natural medicine practitioners suggest keeping an eye on your intake of foods containing L-arginine if you have herpes, since some feel they might be associated with more frequent outbreaks. This might not be true of topical use, but to our knowledge no one has studied it, so we suggest caution until we have more clear data.

Some of these also contain mint oils or other sensation-packed botanicals. Sound like fun? They are, until you’ve had enough and can’t wash it off. Peppermint and cinnamon are powerful sensory agents. Oils are definitely a challenge to “turn off” when you’re ready to end the intense feeling, since they can’t be immediately removed from your body. We love experimenting, so that’s why we say try a tiny dab first—more romantic than hopping madly to the bathtub to wash off a burning clit or dick!





The Five Stages of Lube: The Span of an Adult Sex Life in Lube


by Shar Rednour

1) The Desperate Houseluber You’re young and/or you don’t know better—you grab what’s handy. This is the slippery, slidey stuff that’s on hand when you need it—lotion, Vaseline, shampoo, cooking oils—also known as pervertible lubricant, since none of this stuff was invented to be used as a sexual lubricant at all. These goos are the very thing sexologists, safer sex activists, or Good Vibrations staffers say not to use. Wow, did you and yours have a laugh about this later. Scary. But luckily you grew up and moved on!

Pervertible—noun or adjective. Coined by David Stein, the co-founder of the Gay Male S/M Activists (GMSMA), this word means “any household object you use for sexual or kinky purposes, even though that’s not what it was invented for.”



2) The Shiny Queen Wow, lube! You’re so cool—you actually know about lube now. This means you have sex! Yes! You can’t slow down for the details—you’ve got someone to fuck. You go for the funnest or sexiest branding and packaging: whatever catches your eye. There’s a shelf of purple labels with big splashy names. That looks good—grab that! Or what about the manly stern-looking ones? Oh, Daddy…

3) The Elite Lubester You pick one that’s totally exclusive, only for those in the know because it looks like anything but lube so, uh, you have to be in the know! This is the difference between potato leek soup and vichyssoise. You only buy lube that you don’t understand. If you understand it, then it’s not fancy enough—and it’s a huge plus if the bottles remind you of your upscale hair salon, or maybe test tubes. This one is incognito, disguised as a fancy perfume or bedside lotion… it’s a perfume, it’s a lotion… it’s… a lube! Nobody but you will know for sure.

4) The Lube-oisseur One day you find out your friends care about lube and you have a summit meeting—a critical breakdown of the aspects of lube. You research your lubricants now, analyzing them with a lover or asking a store clerk. With so many options out there, you may be poly about your lube… and use even ones other than your favorite, depending on your mood or your chosen sex act. Like choosing a drink for the appropriate mood or occasion: Hmm… do I want tea, mineral water or a Manhattan? And as a lube-oisseur you remember the day you finally fuck long enough to realize you actually need lots of lube! Now you add to your collection brands that come in large containers with a pump for dispensing instead of fumbling with little bottles and flip tops which you look at with a laugh, thinking, “Amateurs!” You’re going the distance—with a lube that matches your endurance. You use it in an all-day Saturday fuck-fest… it lasts as long as you do.

5) The Chosen One Your skin is an organ like your heart and lungs, and sometimes becomes sensitive to whatever you rub on it. You used a lube that felt perfectly fine one day, but the next your body rebelled: Every lube felt like it was dosed with itching powder from a Tom & Jerry cartoon. You used to be able to mix and match all these lubricants, but something’s changed… it’s you, not the lube. Your bedside trash bin looks like The Island of Forgotten Lubes—full of barely-used tubes and pots. You’re down to the one lube that you found in your quest and it rises high above the lubricant graveyard like the genital version of an angel statue on a moonlit night. It lubricates without irritation. It is… the chosen one.

Postlogue: The Chosen One stays that way for decades until one day your adult grandchild sees your brand and says, “Oh, Grams—that is so two decades ago. You have to try the latest!” Uh-oh, better go back to Step 3.





GPS for the Body: An Erogenous Map of Your Pleasure Parts


“Erogenous zone” is a fancy way of saying “an area on your body that feels erotic and/or sexual pleasure when touched or stimulated.” Some people have the same basic erogenous zones as most others, perhaps with a few unique areas thrown in—places that are sensitive to them, but not to you or me. On the other hand, there are some areas of the body our culture presumes are sexy, but aren’t for everyone. Nipples, for example: Many people think all women love nipple stimulation, but the fact is that many women don’t feel extra-sexy when their nipples are touched; some do—some don’t. Meanwhile there are countless men who love having their nipples touched or sucked, even though plenty of people have never even thought about doing that.





Why Should I Care About All These Random Body Parts?


You can experience more pleasure as well as troubleshoot when your senses and body change with age or life experience. You don’t have to be a mechanic to drive the car, but you do need to know where the gas pedal is—and most importantly, how to steer!





Pleasure and Physiology: Take off your clothes and get out your highlighters!


Arousal is an important part of sexual response. Following this section we will share the ways the body changes with arousal, but here’s a tease: During arousal, blood rushes to the surface of the body—the skin—and engorges the genitals, increasing sensitivity to touch, vibration, licking, sucking, spanking, or whatever other sexy fun you are enjoying. Don’t worry, there’s more to come—ahem. For now let’s go through our sexual anatomy and include the good stuff that high school sex ed left out.





Homologues: Nobody’s an “Opposite” Sex


Genitalia for One & All


Everyone’s genitals are different in size, color—base skin tone, plus changes during arousal, nerve sensitivity, and response to stimulation. Yet we all have something in common: During the first six weeks of gestation, fetuses’ genitals are the same. All genitals are formed from the same cellular material, even if we later differentiate as female, male or intersex bodies, or cis or trans.

The idea that there are only males and females, and that they are “opposite,” has been part of widely-accepted cultural assumptions and many people’s sex education. But nothing could be further from the truth. “Male” and “female” posters in science class, as well as bodies in real life, are like the ends of a continuum. Each and every part of a woman’s genitals is comparable to every part of a man’s, and this helps us understand just why some people can be intersex, and even what happens during “gender realignment” surgery. It also helps us understand that female, male, and everybody else’s responses might be less “opposite” than we have been taught.

Some people teach that we all start out female, though this is incorrect; we all start out undifferentiated. That is, we don’t have gender yet and we won’t until we are born, since gender is partially a social construct. Nor have our bodies differentiated; we are neutral at first. Gender both develops and is created by genetics, cellular sensitivity to endocrine influences, the parent’s drug use, if any, and general health, and, finally, societal/cultural preferences and notions.





Did You Know?


	The largest adult clitorises are bigger than the smallest adult penises. Even “normal” size is a range, which overlaps between “male” and “female.”



Here are the homologous parts—a two-dollar scientific word that means “corresponding in structure and origin”—and please stay tuned for more detail about these tender bits.

Clitoris and penis: If we didn’t name these two parts according to gender, we’d perhaps call both of them a phallus—we all have this organ system, consisting of a shaft, a tip or glans, and a foreskin/prepuce. As sexologist and anatomy specialist Dr. Robert Morgan Lawrence points out, the sensitive glans is called the genital tubercle when we start out in embryonic form; its only purpose is to provide an input point for voluptuous sensations. This is why surgeons universally try to save the “penis tip” when doing gender realignment surgery, and it’s also the basis of anatomists and feminists stating that the clitoris’s only purpose is to help us feel pleasure. That’s essentially the glans penis’s job as well.

“G-spot” and prostate

Outer labia and scrotum

Vestibular bulbs and corpus spongiosum

Ovaries and testes

Vagina and “vagina pocularis,” a.k.a. “vaginal utricle”

Inner labia and urethra





Knowing about homologues help us understand each others’ erotic sensitivities if we are in female-male couples. But they also help us understand intersex and trans genitals:

One in 500 to 2000 people is born intersex, with genitalia, gonads or chromosomes in some combination/permutation of “male” and “female” parts. Often, intersex babies’ genitals are altered shortly after birth to appear cosmetically like one end of the spectrum, which can result in decreased sensation. Depending on the person’s family and doctor, these surgeries and medical procedures can lead to sexual trauma. Not all parents inform their children they were born with an intersex condition; some adults don’t even know that’s why they were in the hospital when they were kids, nor do they realize this might be related to any current problems with arousal, orgasm or identity.

Transgender people’s genitalia vary greatly, depending on choices regarding hormones and surgeries. Some specifics:



Female-to-Male (FTM): The effects of testosterone, or T, result in an increase of the size of the clitoris in length and width. Trans men don’t usually call it a “clit” at this point, but might say “cock” or something else more congruent with their gender identity. The hormone-enlarged phallus may not be large enough for penetration, though there are exceptions. Top surgery—breast reduction so the person has a masculine-appearing chest—is common for people who can afford it. Bottom surgeries vary: A scrotum can be created from existing tissue, generally the outer labia, then testicular forms are implanted; to create a penis, there are differing procedures. Metoidioplasty surgery allows the enlarged clitoris to be more external, while phalloplasty requires multiple surgeries: a phallus is created using grafted tissue from another part of the body, a glans is shaped, and the urethra is re-routed. A vaginectomy (surgical removal of the vagina) may be chosen as part of this realignment process as well, though many trans men do not take this step; some continue to enjoy that part of their bodies after arousal, though they may choose to call it something else, while some simply opt out of extra surgery.

Male-to-Female (MTF): Estrogen increases breast size and the body’s curves and makes the penis somewhat smaller. For those who opt for surgery, choices include breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, orchiectomy (removal of the testes), and vaginoplasty plus labiaplasty. There are two main choices in this procedure: penile inversion, and colovaginoplasty, in which the new vagina is contructed using a portion of the colon. Tissue from the glans may become the clitoris, which may allow for orgasms. A surgically constructed vagina requires dilation, exercises, and physical therapy. It’s common to hear warnings for trans women about using very large dildos or vaginal fisting; these are not generally recommended due to the amount that these practices may require the vagina to stretch.

Please note: We don’t want you to get the impression that you must focus on trans or intersex genitals to understand the people attached to them. Gender identity is, or can be, completely divorced from what’s in our pants, and it’s not considered at all polite to be fixated on genitals when a whole person is standing in front of you.





The Genesis of “Genitals”


We all know slang words that refer to those bits between our legs usually thought of as sexual organs—our privates, our cock and balls or clit and pussy, to name a few. Then there’s that slightly official-sounding word, “genitals.” We use that word in this book too, because it’s inclusive, in its way. But—here’s a tidbit about the word “genital” that you might not know: It originated in reference to the parts of our bodies by which humans generate—some of us, anyway. That’s right: This word originated because of the relationship of the penis and the vagina to reproduction. But most sex, even among heterosexuals, is not engaged in to reproduce, but rather for pleasure, love, fun, curiosity, and the multitude of other reasons any of us might find ourselves stimulating those parts, or the parts of another. In fact, from the viewpoint of pleasure, reproductive sex is a byproduct.





Genital pleasure is connected to the nerve concentrations in this part of our bodies, an area richly endowed with the nerves that send sensation to our brains. There are at least two nerve pathways to the brain that are relevant to high arousal and orgasm—one connects to the clitoris/penis, and the other one is deeper in, thought to carry stimulating feelings from the prostate and vagina. Here are the body parts that, when stimulated, help generate those signals:

	 Clitoral glans: This is the part of the clitoris we can see (more of the clitoris is internal, inside the body, than is visible on the outside). It’s comparable to the glans (often called “head”) of the penis. These are sensitive tissues that often enjoy being stroked, licked, rubbed, vibrated, and sometimes slapped.

Corona: Ridge around the edge of the head (glans) of the penis; may be especially sensitive. Like the clitoral glans, it forms from the genital tubercle.

Foreskin: Science calls this the prepuce; it’s the usually-mobile skin that covers the head of the penis, mucosal on the inside. It is sometimes removed (usually in infancy) in a process called circumcision. The clitoris has its own foreskin, often called the hood, which is usually somewhat less mobile and retractable than a penile foreskin.

Frenulum: This is the strip of flesh on the underside of the penis, one of the organ’s most sensitive parts. It’s like the bit of tongue on the underside that pulls up tight when you lift your tongue backwards. It joins the foreskin to the underside of the glans.

Inner labia: The inner folds of the vulva nearest the vaginal opening are made of mucous membrane and are often extremely sensitive. They engorge with arousal and may noticeably change color.

Urethra: The tube out of which urine comes from the bladder and ejaculate from the prostate.

Scrotum: Also sometimes called “ball sack”; holds the testicles. Squeezing and tugging might feel good, but no flicking the testicles about! Smooth muscles in the scrotum tighten before orgasm and pull it up much closer to the body. Homologous to the outer labia, the place where the tissue joined during early embryonic growth is visible. It looks like a fine scar midline on a phallus and usually continues up the shaft to the urethra.

Outer labia: The area of the vulva closest to the inner thigh, covered with non-mucosal skin and pubic hair. The labia may engorge with blood during arousal, making the area swell.

Introitus: The opening of the vagina, which is often quite sensitive. Remember that sensitivity can change with arousal.

Vagina: The first third of the vaginal canal responds to vibration and stroking. Deeper areas inside respond to pressure and fullness. During arousal, the vagina may “balloon”—that is, form an expanded area where the vagina and uterus come together at the cervix—during arousal this may become noticeable, which is relevant to intercourse and especially large toy play and fisting.

Anus: Very sensitive tissue. It engorges during arousal and its muscles contract during orgasm. It consists of two sphincters; the outer sphincter muscles move voluntarily, while the inner ones are involuntary.

Prostate gland: The prostate is located via the anus, about a finger’s length in, toward the anterior or belly side of the body. During prostate stimulation, erection may be lost but orgasm or ejaculation can happen without penile stimulation.

G-spot: The urethral sponge (spongy tissue which protects the urethra), located approximately one finger’s length in through the vagina, also toward the belly. This area is much more receptive to pleasure after first being aroused. Both the prostate and the G-spot may feel like a firm bulge about the size of a walnut; these two glands are homologous. The term “G-spot” stands for “Gräfenberg spot,” which is not its scientific name; another term used to describe it is “prostata femina.”

Perineum: The area between the anus and the genitals. The root of the penis and legs of the clitoris—that is, the part of these organs that are inside the body—can be stimulated through this area. Rich in nerve endings.

Corpora cavernosa: These two bilateral cylinders make up the bulk of the penis and can inflate with blood to allow the penis to become erect. Between and underneath them lies the corpus spongiosum, a spongy tube made from the same tissue as the inner labia. As the shaft of the phallus forms in utero, the two inner labia seal together and form the urethra—it this process doesn’t seal all the way up to the glans, the urethral opening can be located along the shaft in a condition called hypospadias.

Clitoral legs: These wishbone-shaped legs (or crura) of the clitoris extend about three inches back on either side of the vaginal opening. They are made of erectile tissue that engorges with blood during arousal, comparable to the crus of the corpora cavernosa.

PC muscles: Also known as the pubococcygeal and Kegel muscles, they connect pubic bone to tail bone in a band that surrounds the anus and genitals. They control the flow of urine, and well-toned PCs can also assist with increased blood flow and more lubrication; toned muscles transmit orgasmic sensation better, since you feel them clenching and releasing during climax.





To Circumcise or Not to Circumcise?


Every infant with a penis is born with a foreskin covering it. In some cultures, all of these babies have historically been circumcised and those foreskins removed; in other places, most remain intact and uncircumcised. Many parents today do not have strongly-embraced religious or cultural backgrounds that guide them in this decision, and it is a less common surgery than it once was. Also affecting the decision is the opinion of some researchers that circumcision may help prevent STIs; of course, so does safer sex. And some are influenced by the anti-circumcision movement: medical professionals who feel this procedure is inhumane, as well as adults who feel their circumcision negatively affected their sensation and sexual response. Some circumcised men undergo a process to restore their foreskin, though they will not be able to get back the original neurology and mucosal nature of the tissue.





Beyond the Genitals:


There’s more to it than clits and cocks, vaginas and prostates. Other erogenous zones[i] are:

Buttocks

Breasts and nipples

Lips and mouth

Ears

Navel and sometimes the sides of the belly

Neck and throat—some cultures eroticize this area far more than we do in the US

Fingers and hands

Toes and soles of the feet

Small of the back

The inner area of major joints: inner elbows, back of the knee, crease of the thigh, armpits





Since We’re Talking Bodies: Self-Exam for Health & Life


Self Breast Exam Due Monthly!


Women, men, intersex and transgender people can all get breast cancer, so it’s imperative that self-exams are incorporated into everyone’s health strategy. Many people do self-exams monthly, in between annual doctor visits. The goal of a self-exam is to learn what your breast tissue is like so that you can identify any changes early enough to preserve your health, since some (though not most) breast masses or lumps may be cancerous. Huge advances in curing and treating breast cancer have saved lives because of hard-working advocates who’ve raised a lot of money for research, and in turn because scientists have developed and found those cures. Detecting a lump or other change early is your best chance at evaluation and, if needed, treatment.

It’s best to do a self-exam every month; women in their menstrual years are usually encouraged to do the exam about a week after their period (hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle can affect the breasts, and size/shape changes and increased tenderness are not uncommon—these factors will affect you less after your period). Men, transgender people (see suggestions below), and post-menopausal women can just pick a date and repeat each month thereafter. Calendar it so you’ll remember to do the exam. Self-exams are a good idea for people in their twenties all the way through the lifespan.

While you can learn about the way your breasts change over time by doing an exam more frequently than once a month, it isn’t recommended to do them too frequently—subtle changes from day to day may make it harder to notice a true change, plus very frequent exams may lead to a “worried well” focus on your health that can give rise to fear and stress.

You don’t need anything special to do a self-exam, but start unclothed from the waist up in a room with a mirror so you can visually examine your breasts first. You’re looking for any changes from the last time, how your breasts compare to each other visually (many women’s breasts are noticeably different from each other in size—this is common and nothing to be concerned about). Look for any visible anomalies—puckering, dimpling, areas that are reddened or scaly, nipples turning a different direction, and other changes. Observe your breasts with your arms at your sides, then, with your arms raised and hands clasped behind your head, then with hands on hips, tensing your chest muscles each time.

Many people do the additional steps of their self-exam in the tub or shower, where feeling the breasts for lumps or changes may be easier by lubricating the skin with soap and water. You can also use lotion, breast exam creams or massage oil for this purpose, although the exam can also be done on breast tissue that isn’t moistened at all.

Many experts suggest doing the exam twice, sitting or standing up as well as lying on your back, because those positions change the way the breast tissue lies against the ribcage and the body wall. Raise one hand and put it behind your head, and examine the breast on that side; then switch. You should cover the entire area of the breast, plus up into the armpit—breast tissue is teardrop-shaped, and extends up that far. There are three ways to include all the tissue—spiral around from the outer parameter of the breast in towards the nipple; feel the entire breast in a back and forth motion; or move from the outside in towards the nipple, as if you were following directional arrows pointing inward and you imagine a wedge pattern covering your breast. Some experts recommend moving the fingers in small circles as you cover the breasts’ complete area. Use any of these methods, but use the same one each month so your comparisons will be more accurate. When you’ve covered the entire breast, gently squeeze the nipple to look for unusual discharge.

It can take practice to develop a sure touch. Instead of poking with your fingertip, try pressing with three finger pads. Breast tissue is not uniformly smooth; it is glandular, and some people have fibrocystic breast tissue that seems lumpy. It’s important to learn what your breasts feel like ordinarily so you can notice any changes over time. Sexologist and breast cancer survivor Sueann Mark, PhD, ACS (American Cancer Society) adds that, when examining the breast, it’s important to use three levels of pressure: light, just at the surface of the skin, which is where you can feel the adipose or fatty tissue; medium, in the bulk of the breast tissue where you will feel the textured glandular and ductile tissue; and deep, down to the ribs/chest wall. Each level is important; a movable lump could sit at the surface in such a way that pressing down on it will move it out of the way, making it unlikely to be felt. A lump attached to the chest wall can be missed if you don’t palpate all the way down to the ribs. Imagine your fingers descending a spiral staircase if using a circular palpation technique, or going down an elevator if not.

You might want to make a little map of your breasts and take notes about your self-exam; if you find changes in texture that you want to monitor over a couple of months, notes can help you remember from one self-exam to the next what you’re trying to evaluate. If you find changes, tell your doctor.

A self-exam is not a substitute for breast exams at your annual check-up, and conversely an annual check-up is not a replacement for your knowledgeable hands doing a thorough monthly exam. They work in tandem forever and always! And, of course, get mammograms as recommended by your doctor based on your age and health history. We’ve already told you how important it is for you to “Know thyself”: These exams are the best way you can know and love your body, keep track of its wellbeing, and maintain your own peace of mind.





Advice for Trans Men


This advice is for those who’ve had double mastectomy, a.k.a. top surgery.

At Good Vibrations we are quite demanding with everyone else when it comes to saving lives, and you are no different. We have a good deal of experience with this, as we’ve had workers, lovers, and family of staff who have had this operation—so we have some good tips. After surgery, most people decide on which cream, ointment or oil is a part of their strategy for dealing with scarring. You will make your choices about how to treat your skin—many rub their scars with a topical emollient of choice like shea butter. What does this have to do with breast cancer? Since your chest tissue could have many anomalies from surgery, it’s up to you to know your chest best. And what’s a better opportunity than a daily scar rubdown? Rubbing your chest scars right after surgery, including up under your armpits, and memorizing every rise and fall, lump, bump, and wave of your ribcage is not just good for scar reduction, it’s also a roadmap to your chest. This is imperative when it comes to detecting cancer early and saving your life and your peace of mind. Imagine if you don’t do a self-exam for a year, then suddenly feel something that upsets you—and it turns out to be mere scar tissue? So we do mean for better and/or for worse—know your chest starting right after surgery. Follow the same “how-to” tips above in order to be thorough.





How to Do a Testicular Self Examination


Testicular cancer is most common for men ages fifteen to thirty-five, so self-examinations need to start at age fourteen.

For men over the age of fourteen, a monthly self-exam of the testicles is an effective way of becoming familiar with this area of the body and thus enabling the detection of testicular cancer at an early—and very curable—stage. Why do you need to do it monthly? Because the point of the self-exam is not to find something wrong today. The point is to learn what everything feels like when things are normal, and to check back every month to make sure that nothing has changed. If something has changed, you will know it and you can do something about it.

The testicular self-exam is best performed after a warm bath or shower. (Heat relaxes the scrotum, making it easier to spot abnormalities.)

Here is how to do the self-exam:

	 If possible, stand in front of a mirror. Check for any swelling on the scrotal skin.

Examine each testicle with both hands. Place the index and middle fingers under the testicle with the thumbs placed on top. Roll the testicle gently between the thumbs and fingers—you shouldn’t feel any pain during the exam. Don’t be alarmed if one testicle seems slightly larger than the other; that’s common.

Find the epididymis, the soft, tubelike structure behind the testicle that collects and carries sperm. If you are familiar with this structure, you won’t mistake it for a suspicious lump. Cancerous lumps are usually found on the sides of the testicle, but can also show up on the front. Lumps on or attached to the epididymis are not cancerous.

If you find a lump on your testicle or any other signs of testicular cancer listed below, see a doctor, preferably a urologist, right away. The abnormality may not be cancer, but if it is testicular cancer, it will spread if untreated. Even if it is something else, like an infection, you are still going to need to see a doctor. Waiting and hoping will not fix anything. Please note that free-floating lumps in the scrotum that are not attached in any way to a testicle are not testicular cancer. When in doubt, get it checked out—if only for peace of mind!



Other signs of testicular cancer to keep in mind are:

Any enlargement of a testicle

A significant loss of size in one of the testicles

A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum

A dull ache in the lower abdomen or in the groin

A sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum

Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum

Enlargement or tenderness of the breasts



We hesitate to mention the following list, since anything out of the ordinary down there should prompt a visit to the doctor, but you should be aware that the following symptoms are not normally signs of testicular cancer:

A pimple, ingrown hair or rash on the scrotal skin

A free-floating lump in the scrotum, seemingly not attached to anything

A lump on the epididymis (or tubes coming from the testicle) that feels something like a third testicle

Pain or burning during urination

Blood in the urine or semen



Remember, only a physician can make a diagnosis, so if you think something feels strange, go see the doctor! Embarrassment is a poor excuse for avoiding a medical exam. If you think there is something wrong or something has changed, please see your doctor!

Orgasm


Each orgasmic experience is as unique as a fingerprint.

Orgasms can be barely there, a faint quiver, a show-stopper, or a spasmodic clench. Though we often talk about orgasm as the be-all and end-all of sex, many people may never have one and some don’t want to or don’t care if they ever do. Each person’s sexual experience is unique, so your best bet is to discover your own preferences and responses, rather than try to imitate someone else’s. We highly recommend treating orgasms as a possible, even probable, outcome of sexual exploration instead of the goal of a sexual experience—if for no other reason than focusing too intently on an orgasm will often make it impossible to achieve.





The Emotional and Mental Side of Orgasms: What’s So Sexy about the Brain?


Orgasms are whatever you perceive them to be. How you feel about yourself, your partner, the specific sexual activity in which you’re engaged, and your feelings about sex itself—all these elements and more affect your sexual experiences. One significant reason is that orgasm happens in the brain—yes, that’s right—we think of orgasm as a response that occurs in the genitals, but the peak of pleasure, and the instructions sent to the body that result in a clutching of the sheets, gasping or shouting, thrashing around, or even just the simple tension and release of a small orgasm—all these are dictated by the brain. Thus, mental and psychological elements, not to mention individual brain chemistry, can greatly affect arousal, which in turn runs the engine of sexual response and orgasm.

The human brain has often been called the largest sex organ in the body. In addition to being the center of orgasmic response, the brain is central to emotions and fantasy—both of which most people consider related to sexuality. It used to be thought that orgasm happened in the central brain, but a more recent study indicates that it happens in the supraorbital prefrontal cortex. Like most sex studies, this is only an indicator, since so few people were included in the study.

Our ideas about sex, pleasure, and our right to enjoyment influence the way we experience arousal and orgasm. Sometimes our understanding of orgasm has been so highly influenced by popular culture—in the form of romance novels, sex movies, and magazine descriptions—that we don’t recognize the feeling when it occurs. We’ve come to expect it to feel like something other than the way it actually feels, and we end up disappointed, confused, or thinking we were somehow misled, sometimes causing people to think they did not have an orgasm when they actually did.





Orgasm Quiz


	Orgasm might feel:

	 	like a pleasurable muscle spasm;

	 	blinding and out of control;

	 	overwhelming;

	 	underwhelming;

	 	like a spiritual experience;

	 	all of the above.





	 	If you said number (6), you’re the winner! Reward yourself with an orgasm, or at least a pat on the back.





Open communication, honesty, and expressing your needs, likes and dislikes can help the experience of partner sex be pleasurable and orgasmic. Our partners cannot read our minds—and remember, we are all unique, so there’s no magic button or single technique that works for everyone.

By understanding how and why orgasm occurs, people can reach a better understanding of their own bodies—and the more you know your body, the more easily you can experience pleasure and orgasm.





The Role of Desire


One problem that results from believing there’s a certain definition of “normal” sex is that not everyone wants the same kinds of sex. Different people desire different types of people, want to engage in different sex acts, and enjoy different kinds of sensations. One person finds certain kinds of people erotic while someone else doesn’t; someone sees a not-usually-sexual object such as a shoe or pantyhose and gets turned on; another needs a particular kind of touch to enter arousal mode, or fantasizes acts or scenarios that another person never even considered.

If you want to learn a lot about sex, pay attention to your desires and responses and you’ll glean the most relevant information about sexuality—your sexuality. Maybe you want a person or a kind of experience you can’t have; this desire is still part of your sexual make-up even if you can’t engage in it. Or maybe you have fantasies that would be dangerous in real life, and you want them to remain fantasies only. Maybe you will never be a truck driver, or six feet tall, or have fairy wings or fantasy boobs…or, or, or! What you can do is allow fantasy to animate your sexuality. Past experiences of desire and arousal are relevant as well. Your sexual response may change over time, so past experiences may work best as a place to start, rather than as something to try to recreate. You can have the pleasure of discovering yourself instead of engaging in the same activities your entire life, or trying to re-create a special sexual moment. That’s the wonderful thing about fantasy and imagination: a real-life sex memory or a never-happened sexual fantasy can bring you pleasure as long as you want it to. If we sound like an infomercial for fantasy, it’s because we’re so in favor of it: endless sex without the stress! This too can be yours for free. Just plug into your fantasy and imagination.





The Physiological Side of Orgasm


Sexologists William Masters and Virginia Johnson identified and described four general stages of the human sexual response cycle: Arousal, Plateau, Orgasm, and Resolution. This model works well as a flexible guideline or reference point for understanding your own responses. Some people may recognize all, a part, or none of these stages in their own personal cycle. When this sexual response cycle was first introduced, it was treated as a Discovery, as in This Is The Way Sex Is! In fact, it’s only a template, not a hard-and-fast norm. The only real norm is diversity and variability. Many variables affect sexual response including age, physical and emotional state, the kinds of sensations experienced, the duration of time spent in erotic stimulation, and, of course, what specific stimulation that is.





The Sexual Response Cycle


Arousal


For many people, the sexual response cycle begins with arousal. People become aroused by a wide range of stimuli. Anything that taps into your senses—a sight, a touch, a fantasy, a smell, a taste, a thought: literally anything—can be arousing, that is, turns one’s attention to sex and exerts subtle or major changes in the way a body functions in the moment. Arousal sets off our interest in and readies us for sex—although it doesn’t mean we must have sex every time we’re aroused.

Arousing stimuli increase blood flow throughout the body, including but not limited to the genitals.

You’re making me blush. Increased blood flow to the penis, vulva, clitoris, vagina, lips, pelvic floor, anus, earlobes, nipples, and other erogenous zones can cause those areas to be more sensitive and receptive to touch. You might even see them change color as the blood flows in.

Elbow Sex! This blood flow, and the rush of chemicals that can accompany fantasy or stimulation, makes the nerves more sensitive and better at carrying sensory messages to the brain. A touch that usually would not feel sexual may now become, under the influence of arousal, an erotic act. Sensory changes may feel especially intense in the genitals.

My heart is gonna beat right out of my chest! People of any gender can feel and experience an increase in heart rate, muscle tension, body warmth and flushed skin. Breathing rate may also change.

Is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? Penile erections may occur, as well as contractions of the scrotum and elevation of the testicles. Trans men’s erections may be obvious, but are not always. Women may experience clitoral erection too; in some cases this will be clearly visible, and other times the visual changes will be more subtle.

Slippery When Wet. Women—or anyone with a vagina, regardless of what you call it—may experience vaginal lubrication, swelling of the clitoris and vaginal lips, and lifting of the inner vagina and uterus. Men may experience moisture seeping from the tip of their phallus. Trans folk may experience moisture, as well.

Clutching the sheets. For many people, arousal is evident all over the body, including being expressed in the musculature. Partners may grab each other, arch backs or curl into a fetal position, and toes and fingers may curl or spread out. All these changes have to do with the effects of arousal on our muscles.



But remember, it’s not a back-to-school checklist. Finally, we want to point out that not all these signals of increased arousal occur with every person, yet they may still feel aroused and/or wish to continue being sexually stimulated. It’s useful to be able to read bodily signs and signals, but you don’t have to take an inventory—if someone says he or she wants to be sexual, take that person’s word for it.





Arousal Buzzkills


Some factors that can affect the ability to become erect and/or aroused are: anxiety, stress, becoming distracted, side effects of medications, and various health conditions. See more in our Sexy Setbacks section.



A note about lubrication: It’s possible for a woman to be aroused, yet not be lubricated much, if at all. Some possible reasons for this include: medications such as decongestants and antihistamines; the present timing of her menstrual cycle and whether she is in or past menopause; hydration levels; dehydration caused by smoking or alcohol; a low level of estrogen. Thank goodness for saliva, lubricant, and the tongue!

Arousal and our individual sources of turn-on are an integral step toward orgasm, although orgasm isn’t universally important to everyone. Without arousal, sex can be uncomfortable—it can even hurt. It’s worth it to figure out your own sources and patterns of arousal.





Plateau


During this phase of the sexual response cycle, excitement and pleasure continue, possibly rising and falling. The clitoris may retract under its hood; this is associated with arousal and clitoral erection, though that may be a bit counter-intuitive. The outer third of the vagina may become even more engorged with blood, and sensitivity increases.

The penis may begin to secrete a clear fluid, if it hasn’t already—this can happen almost any time during the sexual response cycle, though some people have little or no pre-ejaculate. This fluid can contain some runaway sperm, so contraception and safer sex can be relevant even before—or without any—intercourse.

During this phase, engorged genitals and lubrication can wax and wane. Responding to these changes and integrating them into your sex play can be more pleasurable than trying to force your body to react in a particular way. For instance, the penis may get soft after being hard for a while; instead of getting upset, just going with the flow and focusing on pleasurable sensations and sexy thoughts or talk will increase the chances that the erection will come back.

The classic definition of “plateau” is the moment or moments just before orgasm, when stimulation has brought on the highest level of arousal you can feel before orgasm begins. The plateau phase may last for a few seconds or for several minutes.

The not-so-classic definition of plateau is that this feeling is actually an orgasm or mixed with an orgasm. It just might not be the kind of orgasm that you read about in the latest romance novel or porn story.

Muscular tension all over the body increases, as does heart rate; breathing may deepen.





Orgasm


From a physiological and scientific perspective, an orgasm is the release of built-up sexual tension, caused by increasing arousal. The arousal and the orgasm both happen in the brain, but sexual areas of the body feel the tension acutely, so much that it feels like the orgasm is happening there, exhibited by involuntary muscular contractions—that’s the pulsing you feel in the genitals and the sheet-clenching effect of a strong come. These are generally accompanied by heightened pleasure—the sensation that we call “climax.”

In people of all genders, contractions can take place in muscles throughout the pelvic region, as well as elsewhere in the body. In men, ejaculation—which is a prostatic spinal reflex that releases semen from the penis—may occur. In some men, ejaculation is forceful, while in others it can be less intense, or even retrograde (meaning it isn’t propelled out the penis, but back into the bladder) or not there at all.

Ejaculation and orgasm are two distinct physiological phenomena; although most men closely associate the two, some men have trained themselves to experience orgasm separately from ejaculation. To learn more about this technique read The Multi-Orgasmic Man by Mantak Chia and Douglas Abrams.

Some women also experience emission, especially during G-spot stimulation. This emission is popularly termed “female ejaculation.”

Some people experience extreme genital sensitivity at and just after orgasm; they may have to cease all contact with penis, clitoris, or anus until this sensitivity recedes.

Blood drains back out from the engorged genital tissue; erectile tissue gradually returns to the person’s normal or resting state.

Objectively speaking, one kind of orgasm is no better or worse than any other, in terms of comparing a “vaginal” orgasm to a G-spot orgasm to a clitoral orgasm—or comparing a penile to a prostate orgasm. What matters is, subjectively, what the person experiencing orgasm enjoys, whether it’s only once, or all the time. Perhaps someone usually has one kind of orgasm, but occasionally has another kind. What makes one or the other more or less pleasurable depends on the person and sometimes on the circumstances. Many people experience a blended orgasm, with input from more than one erogenous zone at the same time.





Resolution


The body returns to a resting or non-aroused state. Sometimes this happens gradually, other times more quickly.

Heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure all return to normal. Some people experience a refractory period following orgasm and/or ejaculation. The refractory period can be as short as a few seconds to as long as a few hours. Penises may not become erect again until after this phase ends completely. Some people do not go into resolution after orgasm, but remain aroused, and may even have more orgasms.





Are You Rising to the Occasion? Techniques for Orgasm


Unsure if you experienced an orgasm? Perhaps you want to orgasm more frequently?

	Here are some tips:

Attitude: Keep it positive. Foster attitudes such as, “I am a sexy and sensual person. I deserve to experience sexual pleasure and feel good.” Above all, while engaged in sexual activity, don’t lose focus by worrying about looking good to your partner, or wondering if you’ll come this time, feeling shame about what you like or fantasize about, or other negative self-talk. Worrying about coming is the most sure-fire method of blocking orgasm. If you must think, focus on pleasurable feelings in your body or imagine an erotic fantasy.

Q: How do I not have an orgasm?

A: Worry about having an orgasm.



Know yourself: If you haven’t already done so, break out the hand-held mirror and get to know your genitals, as our colleague Dr. Betty Dodson taught us to do in her books and workshops. Experiment with different sensations and discover what turns you on most and feels the best. Is one area more sensitive than others? That’s useful information to know when a partner asks you what you like.

Masturbate: Many people have their first orgasmic experiences during masturbation. Some people find that during solo play they aren’t distracted by those concerns that often haunt them during partner sex. They also feel free to spend as much time as they want or need, or give themselves a quickie or, depending on mood, a long hot solo session. Get creative. Add fantasy or other sources of erotic inspiration. Masturbation teaches you what kind of sensations you respond to best; it is an invaluable learning environment and so much more.

Clitoral stimulation: Most women require some type of external/clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm. Most do not orgasm from vaginal insertion alone; if you have heard the opposite, or believe that intercourse is the only “natural” way to come, take our word for it: This is a myth. The best way to have an orgasm—trust the masses of women who know—is to use clitoral stimulation or a combination of both clitoral and vaginal touching. Some women orgasm vaginally, but if penetrative sex begins too soon for optimum arousal then she is likely to become irritated rather than turned on. More and longer thrusting does not create arousal or get her off if she’s not already highly aroused. Intercourse is highly pleasurable for many women, but unless there is sufficient clitoral stimulation, the vaginal focus simply may not be enough to lead to orgasm.

Vibrators: These are a great way to explore your sexual responses, since they provide sustained, consistent stimulation. If your hands get tired, vibes are the perfect way to keep exploring. Sometimes the stimulation is stronger, and might be enough to take you “over the top.” Another reason vibrators are great during both masturbation and partner sex is that they lessen the need to think as much about “to the left, to the right, up, down”—the vibe does that for you, freeing up the mind and body to just experience sensation and arousal.

Kegel exercises: Exercising and strengthening the PC muscles enables many people to experience stronger and more frequent orgasms. To learn more about the PC muscles and how to do these exercises, go here. These muscles are the ones whose contractions are felt most strongly during orgasm; if they’re weak, your orgasm quality will suffer, possibly to the point that you might not even notice when you come.

Be Patient: Enjoy the path of pleasure. Let go of limits. Anxiety about the length of time it takes to come will only increase the amount of time it takes, and in fact may stifle the orgasm altogether—any source of anxiety can do this. In fact, more time spent in pleasurable stimulation will bear fruit in a stronger orgasm. We love quickies as much as the next person, but short-duration stimulation doesn’t wake up all the nerve endings the way that taking more time does.

Breathe: Some people find that they hold their breath during stimulation. Deep breathing can result in stronger orgasms. Orgasm expert Dr. Betty Dodson puts great emphasis on deep breathing. She also recommends that you rhythmically thrust or pump your hips rather than remaining inert during masturbation and partner sex.

Sexual Healing: Many people have had sexual trauma or injury in their past, and some of them have learned that healing from these issues is part of discovering pleasure (and vice versa). We highly recommend Staci Haines’s book and educational movie Healing Sex: A Mind/Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma.





Men (and some trans folk) and Orgasm


Arousal = erection: True or False?

Men can masturbate without having an erection: True or False?



Guys commonly think that they can’t have an orgasm unless they have an erection. In our culture male arousal is solely associated with penile stimulation—to such a degree that you might have never even thought of exploring sensations all over your skin and body, or haven’t tried to bring yourself to orgasm, or engage in partner play, unless you’re hard. It’s worth exploring self-pleasuring, a.k.a. masturbation, without an erection, in order to better understand your body, and possibly open up areas of sexual pleasure that are less penis-focused. Of course, sexual pleasure centered in the penis is fantastic—but why ignore all the other delightful possibilities?

Run your hands over your body, and, as you do, notice how sensations change. See if you notice places that you don’t like being touched, or parts of your body that are surprisingly erotic, and that you just never noticed before. For instance, many men believe that nipple sensitivity is exclusively for females, until they discover theirs are sensitive too. Many women might ignore or not know about the pleasure that nipple stimulation can give male partners. Try enhancing erotic energy with fantasy, or via other avenues. Do all this before focusing on your penis.

Spend time stimulating the corona with lubricant, doing some ball-touching and stretching, and rolling the non-erect penis between your palms; try perineal touching and pressure as well. Some men add anal stimulation; some companies offer toys especially made for male anal stimulation. These are often slim, don’t look like dildos, and have a flared base. Anal or prostate orgasm may feel different from the orgasm that results from penile stimulation; in fact, some men find it more intense. With or without penile stimulation added in, many men can ejaculate without an erection; others do not, but still feel an orgasmic peak, possibly accompanied by the pulsing that’s usually felt when semen comes out of the penis. This sensation is caused by the pulsing of the PC muscles; ejaculation isn’t required for it to be as pleasurable as other types of orgasm.

Additional ways to explore genital touch: Some put pressure over their bladders and push down. Some like to handle their testicles/scrotum or gently pull them downward. We should add here that some men don’t wish to handle their penis at all, and prefer to rub it on the bedclothes or another kind of material. And of course many men, trans women, and intersex folks like the sensations created by sex toys.

We’ve all heard of women who don’t orgasm or don’t have orgasms with partners; but less acknowledged is that some men don’t have orgasms with partners either. Partner sex is so different than masturbation or using vibrators: Coming via one method but not another is fairly common.





Is Orgasm Necessary?


Arousal and orgasm are most definitively good for you! They release chemicals in the brain that ease stress, help you sleep soundly, encourage blood circulation, and can minimize pain. Orgasm is a natural component of human sexuality, and most people who haven’t had one are more likely to be pre-orgasmic than non-orgasmic—that is, they haven’t yet discovered what mix of elements will mesh in exactly the right way to get them to come. Most people can discover what those elements are, if they want to and are committed to learning.



Orgasm is a natural component of human sexuality, and most people who haven’t had one are more likely pre-orgasmic than non-orgasmic.





That said, some people don’t want to. If a person doesn’t desire sex or orgasm, it’s not a good idea to pressure them into it. Not wanting to isn’t the same thing as “I don’t think I can,” “I don’t deserve to,” “It’s wrong,” “My partner will never…”—or any of the myriad excuses people make to explain why they’re just not orgasmic.

Enjoying sex without an orgasm is certainly possible—coming isn’t the only wonderful thing about sex. Having sex regularly without orgasm and being frustrated about it, however, is a sign that you do want a more orgasmic life. If you feel truly satisfied without orgasm, that’s great—everyone should be so lucky as to have a sex life that leaves them feeling satisfied! But if you are telling yourself that orgasm doesn’t matter because you’ve never had one, you deserve the experience, and—like so many people in this sex ed-deprived society—you deserve the information and personal comfort that will maximize your chances of becoming orgasmic.

We quoted Alfred Kinsey ealier, who stated, “There is nothing more characteristic of sexual response than the fact that it is not the same in any two individuals.” That is never more true than in the discussion of orgasms—both how they feel, and how to get there.

Have fun exploring your sexual pleasure, on your own or with company!





Faking it


Many women who do not have orgasms during partner sex fake climax, so if you’re one of them you need not feel alone. Some women think that most women are faking it, and are shocked when they learn that some of their friends are actually having enjoyable orgasms with their partners. Then there are those women who think everyone else is having simultaneous orgasms with fireworks aflare—except, of course, for them. And by the way, we’re writing especially about women, but there are men who fake it, too, and no doubt some genderqueer folk who also clutch the sheets as though they were in paradise when they’re not.

Memorize these three little words, class: Don’t fake it! Again: Don’t. Fake. It! There are at least two major arguments against faking orgasm. One: When you fake it, you are literally teaching your partner to do the wrong things to please you. Your partner thinks they’ve got you all figured out, never dreaming that you’re deliberately putting out false information. This creates a vicious cycle: You haven’t let your partner know what does make you come, so what they do in the future won’t work either, and you’ll have to continue to fake it… and on and on.

Two: You are limiting your own ability to feel pleasure and to learn what you actually do like and what gets you off. Typically, women who fake it either know what works for them but won’t ask for it because they’re afraid to speak up; or else they think their partners should “just know” what they like. Some women, on the other hand, haven’t had enough honest, not faked sexual experience to have yet figured out what will put them on the path to orgasm.

To women who think their partners should just know how to please you: This person is a human being, not a mind-reader or a magician. Most of us don’t even like ordering coffee for a friend without their instructions. “Oh no,” we wonder, “do they want cream? Are they allergic to milk? What about sugar? Is Splenda evil? I wish I’d asked them how they wanted it.” And that’s just a cup of coffee! Do you honestly think your partners can correctly guess what makes your body feel good? Without experimentation, an open-minded attitude, and good communication, such women and couples are trapped in a less-than-optimal sexual relationship, to put it mildly.

What about those times when you can tell you’re not going to come, no matter what? At such times, use words to communicate effectively. Tell your partner, “I don’t think I’m going to come this time, but I want to do this (fill in the blank) instead.” That’s the truth, isn’t it? Faking orgasm is a form of lying; it is untrue physical communication. Instead of faking it, just tell the truth. After all, some people will try and try and try to keep going unless an orgasm or some sort of communication ends the activity. It’s common for women to fake orgasm just so whatever sex act they’re engaged in ends or moves on. We understand: Women choose to do this when whatever is going on sexually has lasted seemingly forever and it’s getting tedious—and that’s sometimes an understatement! Many orgasm-fakers also think they are being kind: They don’t want to hurt their partner’s feelings or bruise their ego. Which is sweet in intention… but still dishonest.





Did You Know?


	Some people think nothing of touching themselves during partner sex. Rather than making their partner responsible for all the stimulation each person gets, they take cock in hand or reach down to their clit and add the kind of sensation they like. It’s not just effective—it can look sexy and feel freeing!



The way for a habitual orgasm-faker to deal with this is to come clean, which is not easy. A lot of partners are likely to take this kind of revelation personally and emotionally; it’s humiliating for them to realize they didn’t recognize a faked orgasm—besides which, many partners really do want to please you, and it’s a blow when they find out they haven’t. Finally, there is the unsettling possibility that they’ll always wonder if you are faking in the future. It fosters the same doubts as any other lies that may be told in a relationship.

As dismal as all this may sound, you can derive comfort in knowing this: Both of you are in this mess because many people don’t get adequate sex education to help them understand how to achieve optimal sexual pleasure, much less the information that everyone’s sexually different. It can help to see a sex therapist during the transition from faking to reality. A therapist can alleviate guilt, embarrassment, humiliation and anger by validating and supporting both of you. If you want to stay together, resolve to start fresh and explore sexual options with an open mind. Treat your sex life almost like a science experiment, with a curious attitude and a sense of fun. Be open-minded about communication, discovering sensations, pace and pressure.

During your experimentations, don’t make a mad rush for intercourse. Figure out what kinds of oral and finger stimulation, sex toy and fantasy play you might like to try. Read books about sex and watch sex ed instructional movies. If you were going on vacation to another country, you’d do a lot of research first, right? Well, a fabulous sex life is that exotic journey-of-a-lifetime, and it costs a lot less to take the trip. Watch When Harry Met Sally, and start talking.





PC Exercises for Stronger Orgasms & Pelvic Health


When you think about working out do you picture yourself lifting weights so you’ll have stronger arms? Some people want exercise to be social and lively, so they might think of salsa dancing. Or surfing. Or they participate in Walk-a-Thons to raise money for good causes. The life-enhancing reasons to exercise are many. Maybe exercise allows you to pick up your grandchild more easily, or helps you feel less rickety getting out of bed in the morning. No matter how old you are, the phrase, “Use it or lose it” applies. Like the rest of your body, the sex organs are surrounded by muscles. The problem is, since these muscles are essentially invisible, you can’t wait until you see something sagging in the mirror to let you know you need a workout!

The pelvic floor is made of muscles, and their tone affects the vagina, penis, and anus—and we can exercise them just as we can our other muscles. The pelvic muscle group is called the pubococcygeal (or PC) muscles. Post-partum mothers, in particular, are sent home with orders to do pelvic exercises, often called Kegels, by their ob-gyns. “Don’t single out mothers!” say sexologists, because almost everyone can benefit from awareness of and attention to the PC muscles. In fact, research has shown a direct correlation between a well-toned PC muscle and the intensity of orgasms in people of all genders. If that isn’t enough reason to get to know these muscles, exercising them can also prevent the urinary stress incontinence frequently associated with aging. Research shows that it is never too soon to start practicing them: as with any exercise, it’s infinitely easier to get started early and keep it up throughout life than to wait for problems to arise.





What is the PC Muscle?


The PC, pubococcygeal, muscle connects at the tailbone, or coccyx and at the pubic bone, a.k.a. pubis. The muscle splits and surrounds the genitals and anus in something like a figure eight.

During orgasm, the PC muscle contracts and releases. It causes the vagina and anus to grip, the penis to bounce, and it helps propel ejaculate. (The penile urethra contains smooth muscle that pulses and also helps with emission.) It’s also the source of the pleasurable pulsing feeling that comes with orgasm. Think of the muscle groups that make up the pelvic floor as the foundation of a house. You want your foundation to be strong enough to ensure your home lasts a lifetime.

All genders have a pelvic floor. It’s come to our attention that some people think that the pelvic floor or saying the “PC muscle” is a reference to the vaginal walls or some other aspect of the vagina. It is not. We talk about the PC muscle and its effects on vaginal strength and sensation, but the PC is not part of the vagina. Rather, the PC surrounds the vagina as well as the internal portion of the penis, the anus, and everything else between our legs.





Ready to Get Fit? Find Your PC Muscles


For most people, the easiest way to voluntarily contract the PC muscle is to start and stop the flow of urine. This is best done in the shower or sitting on the toilet. Once you’ve found it, you can exercise it anywhere, without urinating—in fact, starting and stopping urinary flow over and over is not recommended.

Once you find your PC muscles, working them out regularly is a snap. The bonus to PC muscle strengthening is that it usually feels good. It can be done while masturbating, reading erotica or watching a sexy video. Or you can just do PC exercises while riding the bus or washing dishes. Here are some ways to tone the muscle:

Squeeze/release slowly using a two-count for each

Squeeze/release quickly using a one-count for each

Cycle: Squeeze/hold/release/relax, using a four count for each

Butterfly: quick squeezing



Start off with five reps each and increase these over time until you are doing thirty per day. Many people find that keeping their PC muscles toned increases the length and intensity of their orgasms. Some find that their erections are also somewhat firmer. You may not notice a significant change until you practice for a while and then decide to stop exercising, and see a decline in orgasm intensity. No worry: Unlike some other parts of the body, it’s easy to get these back into shape! Remember to contract and release/relax. Contract and relax. Contracting only, without mindfully focusing on the relaxation half of the exercise, can lead to tense muscles and pelvic floor pain.

Specifically for vaginas: Many people find that locating and working out the PC muscle can be made easier by using a resistive device. This can be anything that’s safe to insert vaginally, like a finger or a dildo. You can try a toy that has a bigger end and a smaller one. Start to pull the device out with your hand while using your PC muscle, tightening the vagina around it to resist. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Devices created specifically for this purpose, such as Kegel Balls or the Betty Dodson Barbell, are simple to use and highly effective.

Lots of people exercise in teams, or with friends, to keep themselves motivated; if that’s true of you, you don’t have to sexercise alone either. You can have a bed full of fun doing Kegels with a lover. They can gently tug on a toy while it’s inside you, or even offer fingers or penis and let you know how hard you’re squeezing on that handy “device.”



Some doctors and midwives recommend that pregnant people work on strengthening the PC muscles in order to help make labor and childbirth easier; they are often used postpartum to get back in shape after a vaginal birth; and, again, these exercises are also frequently recommended for urinary stress incontinence.

These exercises are beneficial for helping anyone feel orgasm more strongly, as well as increasing G-spot pleasure or ejaculation. And back to those mothers-to-be—a good PC workout can help before giving birth, since greater muscle tone is associated with greater flexibility. So start working out!





How Do I Feel Pleasure? Let Me Count the Ways!


	Get Comfortable & Stay Awhile: Position Accessories & Furniture


As we head into thinking about the many ways to have sex, we want to start out with some discussion of items that make various positions and sex acts more comfortable, and maybe even make some sex acts possible that wouldn’t otherwise be do-able.

We’re talking about “position furniture,” and no, we don’t mean your bed. We don’t mean the sofa, armchair, desk, or dining table either, or any of the other family heirlooms that you might already be using to bend each other over and do what the porn stars do. We mean wedges, bolsters, and firm, specially-shaped pillows that are designed to provide support during masturbation, sexual intercourse and penetration allowing you to more easily achieve, and remain in, various positions. There are a myriad of reasons to use these. If intercourse positions are ever difficult to get into because you’re stiff or sore, pregnant, larger-bodied, smaller than your partner—or if you’re searching for optimal angles for G-spot stimulation—these items can sometimes help. Those are just some of reasons people add pillows to their positioning fun. At least one company builds a version with a pocket for storing your vibrator! So thoughtful. If you ever drop your toy in the throes of solo pleasure—vibus interruptus!—you’ll especially appreciate this feature.





Masturbation



Masturbation is a primary form of sexual expression… Masturbation is the ongoing love affair that each of us has with ourselves throughout our lifetime.

	—Betty Dodson, Sex for One





This section is for those who have never masturbated, but also for the many people who masturbate just to get off, maybe taking the same kind of solo ride for most of their sexual lives. Would you like to be even healthier? More turned on? More awake? Sleep deeper? Not worry about STIs? This chapter is, in short, for everyone, from us with love—self-love!




No one ever gets pregnant from masturbation, no one gets an STI from masturbation, and you know you are having sex with someone you love—at least someone you should love!

	—Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former Surgeon General of the United States





One of Good Vibrations’ long-standing mottos is If you want something done right, do it yourself! This is not to say that you can’t beautifully pleasure another person, or they do the same for you. But the underlying basis of sexual response and pleasure is not relationship; it’s the erotic sensations within one’s own body, and masturbation may be the best way to explore these. You get to know yourself, sexually speaking, and whether you think of it as being your own lover or maximizing the information you will show Prince or Princess Charming when you finally meet, you’ll learn about your own sexual response, something that will be useful as long as you’re a sexually active person.

Many people think masturbation isn’t relevant to them because they have a partner—they think of sexual stimulation as the other person’s “job” rather than stimulating themselves, even sometimes. The ideal—or the most common cultural belief—is that sexual interest or arousal, in a couple, leads to sex together, not solo—and for some people it works out that way. But couples, even if devoted and hot for each other, aren’t usually together 24/7. They’re sometimes apart. They work. One could be sick or incapacitated somehow. They might have small children, and are rarely alone together with enough energy to be sexual. Or maybe they are together, but their desire isn’t aligned so they both feel like sex at the same time. Masturbation resolves these situations perfectly, and many couples find that giving each other the space for solo sex, at least once in a while, helps their sexual relationship as a duo. Some couples, in fact, masturbate together, enjoying the erotic feelings, the solo focus, and the togetherness. Among other things, this is a sexy way to be intimate, and a very informative exhibit—each partner gets to see exactly what the other one does for pleasure, including how fast and for how long. This can make them more proficient lovers to one another.





Reasons to Masturbate


It’s good for you.

It relieves tension, which has implications for whole-body health, not to mention maybe making you a nicer person.

Masturbating has been linked to better immunological function, release of mood-boosting body chemicals, pelvic floor health, and prevention of vaginal infections.

It’s a perfect form of birth control.

It’s a perfect form of safe sex.

Masturbating is a lovely way to wake up and seize the day.

It can also help you fall asleep by releasing the day’s tension.

It relieves menstrual cramps and pain in general.

It’s associated with prostate health—ejaculating regularly may forestall problems down the line.

Knowing your body and its responses leads to more pleasure.

Knowing your own body and its responses leads to more pleasure for your potential partners.

This last reason to masturbate we offer to those folks looking for love: Are you familiar with the advice “Don’t go shopping hungry”? Not unless you want to go home bankrupt from buying all those boxes of cookies and still no roast for dinner! Shar always applies that to her dating advice: She says you don’t want to be enticed by the wrong person simply because you want sex. Take the edge off, then your judgment might be clearer as you are looking for your ideal match.





Myths and Outright Lies about Masturbation


Only hard-up people who can’t find partners masturbate. The majority of people, women and men, masturbate, and many of them do so throughout their lives, whether partnered or not.

It’s sinful and wrong. People’s upbringing and beliefs definitely affect their choices about contraception, masturbation, and many other attitudes relating to sex and relationships. Do what’s right for you. Religions vary greatly in their doctrines, so you can back up arguments either way. What we can tell you is that it’s natural to masturbate. There’s an old therapy trick of asking someone to name three things they do differently than their parents—we propose that if your parents set a stage for shame, you might wish to consider reversing that pattern in your own life.

Negative health effects: low sperm count, back problems, hair loss. Au contraire! Masturbation is associated with better health, not worse. As far as sperm count goes, after a man ejaculates, his sperm count is lower than it was before ejaculation, but it doesn’t permanently reduce sperm production. The back problems and hair loss are just myths.

Blindness or hairy palms. Clearly blindness and hairy palms are a total myth propagated to stop children from masturbating! When was the last time you shook hands with a hairy-palmed person? We assure you, masturbation is so common, furry-handed people would be everywhere. And as sexologists love to remind us, you can go blind from masturbation…if you habitually do it while gazing into the sun.

If you masturbate too much you’re a sex addict. Addiction is a tricky word about which even experts don’t agree. In this society we tend to use the word “addiction” when behavior is a problem. If you find yourself unable to go to work/school/take care of your responsibilities to a detrimental degree because of masturbation, then it is problematic. So who is the arbiter of what is too much? If you’re ashamed of masturbating, shame is the problem; if someone else thinks you masturbate too much, their ideas about your behavior may be their problem!



	 Many people begin masturbating when they are small children—there is even evidence that some of us might have touched ourselves genitally in utero, before we were born. Masturbation is a natural act. But many cultures, or individual families, frown on it, which means that many children and teens are given negative messages about it, or were even punished for solo pleasuring, and stopped when they were caught doing it. Some people are so repressed around masturbation that they’ve never even tried it—or at least they can’t remember having done it. Unfortunately, “How to Masturbate” isn’t a section in anyone’s sex education class. In 1994 Dr. Joycelyn Elders was fired from her post as Surgeon General merely for recommending that masturbation “was something that perhaps should be taught” as a means to lower teenage pregnancy and stop the spread of AIDS. Clearly, our society has a serious problem accepting masturbation!

In spite of never getting good information about masturbation, most people figure it out. And some people struggle with learning to, or wanting to, masturbate because of negative childhood experiences or cultural messages. For those people, here are some suggestions and information.

We could define masturbation as anything done to stimulate oneself that puts a person into the sexual response cycle. Mostly, we think of it as genital touching and stimulation, which is the most common form of masturbation—but it isn’t the only stimulating form of solo experience. Some people say they can fantasize all the way to orgasm without any touching—are they masturbating? Maybe they are! What about people so attuned to nipple stimulation that just playing with their breasts gets them over the top?

So the first thing to consider when you start masturbating—or seek to masturbate more mindfully or effectively—is: What do you find erotic besides genital touch? Get to know your whole body. Some people use only hands for this; others like the sensation of objects or fabrics, with certain textures being especially pleasurable. Your skin is an erotic organ, so explore it. Your mind is, too—fantasy is a crucial part of many people’s erotic experience, and during solo sex, you can freely focus on your fantasy life: no worries about messing up partner sex or asking if your partner likes the fantasy (you might think it’s rude to ignore your partner, after all). But during masturbation, you can plunge fully into an erotic reverie while offending no one.





Masturbating Take/s Two: Jacking or Jilling Off with Another Person


If you don’t know someone’s safer sex history, aren’t fluid-bonded, aren’t ready or in the mood for intercourse together, or just want to put on a sexy show for each other, try masturbating together. It’s perfectly safe, as long as you aren’t sitting so close that you splash ejaculate or other fluids on each other, it’s also sexy, and an excellent way to show and observe what kind of hand technique—speed, position, movement, and so forth—each of you use for solo stimulation.

Reasons for dual masturbation—it:

is safe sex

makes intercourse hotter

allows you to see and learn—it’s sexy and informational

can enhance a couple’s intimacy

makes for fun “lazy” sex or a good quickie

is perfect for those who want to prolong courtship and wait for intercourse

is an erotic way to feel spiritual together, or achieve higher energy states

is a way to bring couples together erotically who can’t or don’t want to have intercourse





Are you nervous about showing off this way? Do it in the dark first, or close your eyes. Talk erotically together while doing it. Focus on the other person and ask them to show you their technique. Do it side by side while watching an erotic movie. Add sex toys or garments to change up the feel and the fantasy.





Genital exploration is part of masturbation. Try new activities. Touching your pleasure parts with your hands versus objects versus materials lets you explore different sensations. For such a relatively small area of the body, there’s a lot of variation in sensation and titillation between the legs, a great many nerves to cause pleasure or discomfort. On the other hand, despite many nerve endings, some touch will feel just meh. Make sure to read the section about arousal to understand the role of time and physiological arousal, since your body will not like certain kinds of sensation unless you’re turned on, and it may take some time to get there. Vaginal and anal insertion is a good example of this—for many people, if you start intercourse or masturbation with a dildo too soon, it won’t be pleasurable and might even be painful, but when aroused, it can feel terrific. Learning about genital anatomy will help you understand which sensations are likely to be most enjoyable, and why.

The simplest way to think about masturbation, and of your options when you do it, is to imagine that you’re having sex with yourself. Some of the sexual techniques we explore in the rest of this book might influence your masturbation choices; on the other hand, this is exactly why it’s great to masturbate: You can learn a lot from it, especially about yourself, and about the techniques you’ll like when with a partner. But it’s also important to note that some people do different things when they masturbate than they do with partners, like focusing on the clitoris with no vaginal insertion; enjoying anal stimulation alone but not with a partner; reading erotic stories or watching movies during solo sex but not with another person. For some, masturbation preferences are just like their erotic partner-sex preferences; for others, they might be very different indeed. It’s each person’s individual and unique choice.

Let’s consider those pleasure parts and our masturbation options.

The vulva and clitoris: The clitoris is the main area of erotic sensitivity for many women and trans guys, though of course the latter may have different words for it. The clitoris can vary in size—and if a trans man takes testosterone, it will grow even larger— but even when its exposed glans looks very small, it’s a body part that packs thousands of nerve endings into that mini-but-mighty area. The clitoris is part of the vulva, which the external area that includes the labia and the vaginal opening, but not the vagina itself. We very much respect the clit at Good Vibrations—for one thing, it is an ideal part of the body for enjoying vibration, though many other kinds of sensation can also make for a happy clitoris. The clit is so sensitive for many that indirect stimulation feels best, especially at first, and anyone who doesn’t like clitoral stimulation may feel that way because they haven’t been fortunate enough to find just the right kind of touch. Though there’s no rule that says everyone must be a clits-first kind of person, we do know that clitoral sensation is crucially important to the sexual response of many, many women. It can help us relax, help us manage chronic pain more successfully, and if we’re lucky lead us to transcendent heights of pleasure.

The rest of the vulva deserves to be lauded too! Touching the labia, both inner and outer, can cause very enjoyable sensations: Some people touch them gently, some grab and tug, and everything in between. The clitoris can be stroked, rubbed in circles, up and down, or side to side, grasped between two fingers, pulled, pinched—and any clitoral touch is likely to feel different or possibly better if done with lubricant. Just as some people like oil for massage but others like deeper touch on pressure points when their skin is dry, lube creates different sensations and can be added or omitted to clitoral and vulva touch as you prefer.

For some, touch needs to start very gently, but when higher arousal kicks in, stroking may be quite fast, rubbing done with much more pressure. Some like the sensation of a stream of water on the clitoris and vulva; this can be done with a hose, a hand-held shower device, a hot tub jet, a WaterPik™, or just by scootching one’s body down to the base of the bathtub and letting the faucet run. Watch out for temperature when playing with water—not too hot. And make sure the water pressure and temperature stay stable—it can be annoying and even dangerous if your neighbor flushes, thereby making the cold water slow down and your water get too hot. Finally, it’s not wise to let a pounding stream of water rush directly into the vagina.

Vibrators are fantastically suited to clitoral/vulva masturbation. The clitoris and penile head contain an abundance of nerves that respond strongly, and often with great pleasure, to vibration.

Wait, back up. The second we say “masturbation” or “vibrator” some people immediately think of inserting a toy into the vagina. In short, they think of “sex” as intercourse, a.k.a. penetration, therefore masturbation is too. Surely you’ve gotten our take on that by now! Oftentimes folks assume that vibrators are toys that are supposed to be used for vaginal insertion. The fact is, however, that the clitoris is much more sensitive to vibrations than the interior of the vagina. Many people stimulate both at once, either with a toy in each hand, their fingers doing vaginal insertion, or with a “Twice as Nice” toy that has a clitoral stimulator attached to its shaft; while others focus on their clitoris only. Different vibrators’ intensity ranges from mild to powerful, and many have multiple programs built in—they can give a consistent buzz or a BUZZbuzzBUZZbuzz wave pattern, or an on/off/on/off pulse—just like your blender! They are small appliances, you know; some even have memories like computers and remember the pattern you used the last time you had the vibrator switched on. We live for vibes and think everyone should check them out. Not everyone loves them, though, as we do: This is just one of the countless individual preferences that makes each person’s sexuality unique.

The penis and testicles: Many people with penises have developed a tried-and-true stroke and can get themselves off very efficiently. Sometimes testicle play is involved—fondling, pulling downward—and sometimes not. It’s frequently done with a dry hand, or the palm can be slicked with saliva. Even for these expert masturbators, altering technique can be worthwhile: adding lubricant, slowing down the stroke, adding ball play if it isn’t usually incorporated, focusing on the head more than usual, playing with the foreskin. All these options can vary sensation while masturbating—a lot. Specific sex toys are made for the penis, some incorporating vibrators or suction pumps; some are sleeves, so that stroking doesn’t only happen with the hand. Some may find that sleeves reduce skin-on-skin friction somewhat; if hand-on-penis ever becomes irritating, they’re worth exploring just for this reason. And speaking of hands—they’re optional when masturbating (though helpful, for sure): We’ve met people who rub their penis on the sheets while lying on their bellies.

It’s often assumed that if a penis isn’t hard, it’s not going to feel sexual sensation, but this isn’t always the case, and even people whose penises do not get erect may appreciate the sensations of masturbation—including vibration. A few toys have been designed for men or trans women to use while soft; they can either be used to help get an erection, or simply to enjoy sensation without getting hard.

There are many nerve endings in the penis; stimulating a soft phallus may feel different, or require alterations in technique, but it may also crack open the door to new erotic possibilities. There is more to a man than a hard-on, and more to erotic pleasure than penile sensation.

The vagina: Some people do definitely like vaginal insertion as part of masturbation, with fingers, a dildo, a vibrator, or even an appropriately-shaped household object or fresh produce like a zucchini. For both vaginal and anal penetration, remember: nothing sharp, scratchy, or breakable; before and after, clean whatever it is you’re using; and consider that a sex toy made for precisely this purpose might be safer in many cases than whatever you’re tempted to grab from the vegetable bin or tool shed. The nerve endings beyond the first third of the vagina primarily transmit pressure, fullness and motion. Some people like an in-and-out motion, while others enjoy a sense of fullness. Fans of fullness may decide to use toys of a different size and shape than folks who are in-and-out aficionados. A toy that has more girth or is bulbous might especially please those who like to feel full. Even a person who masturbates in a way comparable to intercourse may still not want to actually have intercourse with another person, but want to keep this form of sex strictly solo.

Fingers moving a little way into the vagina impart a different sensation than does a curved dildo or vaginal balls, or any of the other toys and modes of stimulation. Vaginal play comes in a wide variety of forms. Remember too that the vaginal path leads to the G-spot, which some (but not all) women find sensitive and pleasurable.

Some vaginal insertion feels fine without lubrication, but it’s always a good idea to have some handy because vaginal wetness varies for each person. The larger the toy or other insertion, and the more intense the movement, the more helpful, even necessary, lubricant becomes.

The anus: Like the vagina, the anus sometimes likes to be entered and appreciates motion and fullness. Our section on anal sex will give you all the information you need for anal play, all of which is relevant for solo play as well as partner sex. Always remember: anything used for anal insertion MUST absolutely have a base so it cannot slip inside, and it must be unbreakable and completely free of sharp or rough spots. These are not variable preferences; these are hard and fast rules to be followed without fail!





“Pull the Self-Pleasure Out of the Hat” Game


Put each one of these onto its own slip of paper (whether you write them out or copy this page of the book, then cut them out). Then fold each one up and put into a hat or a box. Pull one out and try the suggestion listed—once a day? Once a week? There are no “losers” in this game!

Try masturbating every morning, especially in winter, to avoid depression. (This is not a substitute for getting help for clinical depression—but orgasm will send a rush of feel-good chemicals into your body, so it’s worth a try!)

Use masturbation as Kegel workout time. Sure, everyone says you can do your Kegels any time—“even on the bus!”—and it’s true, but why not have a little more fun doing them? Jack or jill off while tightening up on a vaginal barbell or dildo.

Add a hot fantasy of your own, or read one that someone else has written.

Wear fetishistic or sexy garments that turn you on.

Try multiple orgasms: Go until you can’t go any more. Some people masturbate until they have their first orgasm and that’s it. Have you ever tried coming and coming and coming until you just can’t come anymore? You have our permission. If you get too sensitive after Orgasm #1, put your hand lightly over your pleasure parts and wait for that feeling to fade and for touch to feel good again.

Settle down with an erotic movie or story to jump-start your arousal.

Try sustaining that pre-orgasm/high plateau state: What about trying not to come? Touch yourself and get really excited, almost orgasmic, then pull back and do not let yourself orgasm yet. That trick can be such sweet torture, as well as training for sustained sex with a partner.

Use toys, your hands and whatever else you’ve got handy to stimulate several parts of the body simultaneously.

Practice dirty talk or fantasy talk while touching yourself. Ever worry that you might not sound smart and savvy when trying to say something sexy? When you are really aroused and alone is the perfect time to practice hot talk. Plus it can actually arouse you more to do it.

Breathe. We do it all the time, but if you consciously use your breath during masturbation, you may be able to alter your experience quite a bit. Try holding your breath; breathing deeply; staying super-conscious of breathing in… breathing out… breathing in. Breathing deeply can relax you, which is great for insertive play, or if you’re stressed.

Do you like anal sex? How would you know if you’ve never tried it? Masturbation is the perfect experimental safety zone. You could try using a toy or finger anally while relaxed, at home with no pressure to please someone else—as a matter of fact, no pressure to even please yourself—if you don’t enjoy it, you can stop. Trying a small anal toy, inserted while stroking your vulva, clitoris or penis, helps you see if you like it. That goes for touching your neck, pinching your nipples, and vaginal penetration as well—in fact, almost any kind of sexual touch can be tried out via solo sex.

Any of the above can add more pleasure to self-pleasuring, so the game of trying them all gives you permission to prioritize yourself. As long as you’re not harming your body, be creative. Enjoy yourself.

So, ladies, gentlemen, and everybody in between, let’s hear it for masturbation! Hurray for this unsung pastime which helps make life worth living. Solo sex is central to a well-lived life. People masturbate for pleasure and to relieve tension—both are highly worthwhile. Our English word “masturbation” has bad historical attitude embedded within it—one translation is “self-pollution”—but we’d advise you to ignore that and meditate on one Chinese translation of the word: “self-comfort.” Doesn’t that make you feel better already? Care enough about yourself to give yourself erotic comfort!

In or out of a relationship, you can give yourself pleasure. This may be especially important for the women who got the not-so-useful cultural message, “Someday my prince will come, and so will I”—but for people of all genders, solo sex says, “You’re worth it.” Some relationships can be stressful or toxic—but you can always let lovely, pleasurable, self-focused alone time restore your balance and remind you that you’re your own person. Your pleasure is in your own hands.





Kiss and Tell



Kissing—and I mean like, yummy, smacking kissing—is the most delicious, most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do, bar none. Better than sex, hands down.

	—Drew Barrymore





People have been kissing one another with love and romance—or at the very least, lust—in their hearts for over 5,000 years. Kissing can be a sex act unto itself. And it’s commonly the point at which desire and juices start flowing if you are going to do more than lip-lock. Many people think if you are a good kisser that you are good in bed—the promise of a good lover is what many people look for in a first passionate kiss.

There are two things we know for sure about kissing. First, kissing is subjective. You might think Terry Smith is a fabulous kisser, yet your best friend thinks Terry is awful. Like other kinds of erotic activities, kissing is experienced and preferred differently by different people. It’s also important to note that arousal and attraction can affect how much you enjoy a kiss.

The second thing we know: Kissing is objective—some people really are great at it and some aren’t. What makes them that way?





Kiss and Learn: Technique


So think about it: What kind of kisser are you? What kind of kisses do you prefer? If someone asked what kind of kisses you liked, would you be able to tell or show them?

It’s hard to talk while kissing, so you can’t ask someone, “Do you like the way I’m kissing you?” or “If you want me to do something different, show me”—words we recommend for many, if not most, sexual activities. But you can certainly break the kiss for a moment to ask such questions, and to say any other sweet nothings or erotically-charged talk you want to, and then get back to it. The clearest way to gauge how your kiss is being experienced by the kiss-ee is simple: Ask. Now, if they’re shy, they might not have the nerve to speak up with, “Your tongue is all the way past my tonsils! Eww!” or “You’re grinding my head into the headboard!” But if there’s more to learn about the subtleties of kissing this particular person than they are spelling out, here are two bodily-focused ways to find out.

Pay attention to how and whether they kiss you back. If they are giving and not just getting, they’re either enjoying it greatly, or attempting to add the kind of stimulation and technique they like by doing it themselves. So pay attention to what they do—where their tongue is, and how they move it, how open their mouth is or isn’t, whether they are subtle or rougher—and try to do the same back to them.

The other way is to ask them to kiss you the way they like it best, and pay attention to their demonstration.

If they are not kissing you back, maybe they’re shy or submissive and just letting you run the smooch. But this might also be a sign that you’re not doing it the way they like it. Double ditto if they try to move away: This means you’re kissing too aggressively, or even that they don’t want to kiss at all. You did get consent for this, right? Maybe they just don’t want to kiss like that. If you think kissing must always be fast and voracious, and that’s how you do it with everyone, we have two words for you: Slow down! And if you’re a slow kisser to begin with, you might find it wonderful to go even slower.

Many people start with deep French kissing—that is, open mouths, with tongue—right away; this may not be the best technique, though, especially if your partner is not leaping on you with equal vigor. Try beginning with lips alone. Lips are ultra sensitive—in fact, deep kissing technique may not optimally engage the delicious nerve endings of the lips at all, and the best way to do that is with another set of lips, or possibly the tongue. Starting slowly works up desire, makes you want more; starting with “more” runs the risk that you’ve gone too far too fast. As Robert Frost wrote, “Love at the lips was touch/As sweet as I could bear/And once that seemed too much…”

Remember—you’re right up against their face: You can feel their breath—and they yours; smell them; and taste them. When you’re kissing, many senses come into play.

You can kiss without touching the other person anyplace but the lips: It’s a rather sweet exercise, in fact, to simply keep your hands to yourself. But many kissers hold each others’ heads or faces, and this adds stimulation, helps work out the angles of contact—including the all-important issue of avoiding nose-bumping. It can add a degree of dominance and submission or erotic fierceness. Remember that where you kiss can stray away from the lips. Try kissing all over their face and throat; this can be intimate and seductive or feel intense and devouring—lips only, no tongue!

Tongues can be central to the kissing experience, and rightly so: The tongue is a warm, wet, mobile organ that can be as important to eroticism as to dining enjoyment. It can turn kissing into a kind of penetrative sex which many people find highly erotic; it can slither in and out of the mouth and touch parts of your partner that are sensitive and definitely not casual public areas. But all tongue-kissing is not created equal, and some people have marked preferences about tongue action: all the way, subtle, or somewhere in between; with no-go zones, in some cases, that do not like tongue sensation even as other parts of the lips and mouth love it; and varying preferences too about the amount of saliva in the mix. Nearly-dry kissing can be a more subtly erotic experience and isn’t enough for everyone; very wet kissing can be a bacchanal for the mouth, or can be experienced as slimy and unpleasant.

Some kisses are soft in every way, while other kisses involve not just the tongue but even the teeth. Nibbling and biting might not be every kisser’s preferred mode of contact, but some people love the touch of teeth not just on lips but on the cheeks, the chin, along the throat. A hickey is sometimes also called a “love bite”—it involves mouth suction plus extra tongue and teeth and can be quite a passionate experience. As you may have already discovered on your own, it can also leave quite a mark.

And if there’s one classic place to nibble, it’s the earlobe. For some, ears are very erogenous; sensations there, whether from softly biting teeth or the explorations of a mobile tongue, are a big turn-on. “Blow in my ear and I’ll follow you anywhere,” they used to quip on Laugh-In (a television program that aired in the late 1960s to early 70s), and it’s true that a little warm breath aimed into the ear is an erotic trick that some people just love. As ever, some people don’t find this a favorite, so consider whispering, “Do you like this?” into the ear in question.

Here’s a never-ending debate: Eyes open or closed? For some, the eyes are the windows to the soul, and close-contact eye-gazing while mouths are locked is the height of erotic intimacy. For others, it’s way too much, and they prefer eyes dreamily closed.

When people are highly aroused, some of these subtleties might mean less than at the beginning of a make-out session where it could go wrong or right. If someone is highly turned on to you, they will probably be somewhere in the pleasure cycle before your lips ever touch. Kissing is often a preamble to sex but can also be an end in itself. Sometimes the kiss is your only chance to make your case. If you want to be experienced as a good lover, you have to start by being a good kisser.





Touching


We touch each other in so many ways when being erotic or having sex that it’s hard to list them all. Bodies brush one another or press hard together. We can touch with our hair, our beards, even our eyelashes. Body parts become touching agents, and can feel very different from being touched by hands. The hands—perfect for touching, and perhaps the most skilled and sophisticated sexual organs we have—can roam all over the skin, tickle or caress, hold or seize, or home in to our pleasure parts and focus on stimulating them. Many a lover can be judged by how they use their hands; movies are chock-full of bodice-ripping moments and passionate embraces in which lovers’ hands and arms are used to convey passion, intent, and desire.

The skin is covered with nerves that are stimulated by touch, and we can have clear preferences about the kind of touch we like as well as where. Many of us have areas that are too ticklish or irritable or even numb to enjoy touch. Some find that soft touch bothers them; for others, gentle touch is the only kind to which they respond. But remember that our tactile sense can be extremely important for arousal, and that the whole body can potentially respond erotically to touch.

It is certainly an irony that eager partners are trying hard to master the art of touching the clitoris, while in many cases they ought to be starting somewhere else, like at the feet. The skin is a sensory organ in its own right, and for many people, sex and arousal are far more pleasurable when kick-started by all-over-the-body touch. And the feet are especially sensitive for many people. There are neurological connections between the feet and the genitals, and while not everyone likes to have their feet touched, rubbed, or licked—for one thing, some of us are too ticklish—others do find it positively orgasmic. We’ve already told you in discussing the many things we can learn from differently abled people that it is possible to have an orgasm without genital touch, and this is a further demonstration of that fact. So lovers wanting to mix it up should get out the massage oil, try licking and sucking the toes, or try intercourse or oral sex positions that allow you to touch the feet at the same time as you do other delightful, sexy stuff. By the way, if your partner is nervous about smelly feet, just say you’ll meet them in the shower. And if they’re too ticklish to enjoy sensations on their feet, it can make a difference to use massage oil and really add pressure to a foot massage; ticklish responses often come primarily from light touch, not firmer pressure and squeezing.

Going immediately for genital touch may sidestep a crucial source of turn-on. Learning to touch is a central part of being a good lover—in fact the case could be made it’s the most important thing. More ways to bring touch in as a vital element of sexual play: Holding on to a partner’s breasts while they straddle you during sex not only lends erotic touch, but also stabilizes your bodies and helps make that position easier to do and sexier. Grabbing or spanking an ass can be sexy for both partners and can help build up to genital touch; try it before you reach between your lover’s legs. Your hands’ ability to touch, caress, and seize let you calibrate your erotic encounter: Learn the art of the tease and build up response gradually and deliberately.





Self-Discovery: Body Mapping Exercise


Clinical sexologists have developed an exercise called Body Mapping that can help you understand, and use, touch in better ways. If you have a partner, try it. You can try this exercise solo too, but sometimes you can’t compare the touch of your own hand to that of another person, and it works better for most people when someone else does the touching.

Ask your partner to lie down near you, naked, then proceed to stroke different areas of their body, one at a time. After each stroke, they’ll rate the touch according to their positive, negative, or neutral experience and say One, Negative One, or Zero. This helps you learn which parts of their body like touch best, which areas aren’t so sensitive, and which they don’t like to have touched. All by itself, this lets you know so much about their body and touch preferences, which is useful during sex and sensual play.

Another level of this exercise is to use different kinds of stimuli to see whether this changes their response: a feather, a vibrator, a firmer touch (like a spank or a grab), touching with lubricant rather than dry. The first map of the body tells you one thing; you may find that mapping the body using these different methods of sensation gives you much more, and possibly different, information.

You may find that dry touch on the clitoris isn’t desired or even tolerated, but lubricated touch is. You may find that light touch on the upper arm feels neutral, but a grasp feels sexy. You may also find that if you try Body Mapping twice—once when your partner isn’t aroused, and once when you’ve been having sex and they are aroused—that the results are remarkably different. After sex, some body parts may increase in sensitivity and their ability to feel pleasure. You’ll probably also find that a certain touch can be too much and not feel good any more. This, too, is good to know.

Once you learn all this—trade places so they can map you. Then talk about the exercise to give and get more detail about these preferences.

Our individual histories can affect touch preference. One person learned to love a particular kind of genital touch via masturbation, another loved it with their first sex partner. Yet another person had unpleasant experiences and doesn’t eroticize this act at all—in fact, they’d prefer never to be touched that way. As we’ve said many times and in many contexts, there is no one way that everyone experiences sex—in this case, sexual touch.

The other significant variable in touch response—which you might have noticed with Body Mapping—is sexual arousal. When a person is turned on, they tend to like more types of touch. A stroke that was too firm or rough when not aroused might feel good when they’re further along in their sexual response cycle. Arousal even mediates pain, and one reason some people eroticize pain, as in BDSM, is that it happens to them in an erotic context. If anything changes a person’s ability to become aroused—health issues, relationship problems, a drop in libido due to medications, menopause or stress, or many other factors—their ability to enjoy touch may be compromised. And just as the young of many species, not just our own, need touch for emotional health, adult humans often find that touch is crucial for bonding and intimacy. Beyond an explicitly genital focus during sex play, regular contact between partners may help keep erotic channels open; a seemingly casual touch is sometimes the first step toward an erotic encounter even between strangers; and touch is a sexual element that can make the difference between a so-so experience and a great erotic encounter.





Oral Sex


Compared to a hand job, oral sex can seem more intimate and intense to both giver and receiver, and here’s one reason why: Your tongue has its own intelligence. So do your hands, of course, but there’s something about the wet, slippery feel of a tongue on our sensitive bits—with our partner’s face buried between our legs and the many sensations we feel from the movements of this flexible and practically prehensile organ—that can’t compare to anything else. This is a sexual activity that engages all your senses; it’s very immediate and easy to get lost in. Whether you’re a blowjob queen or king, or more interested in becoming a cunning linguist—get it?—let’s dive into the many splendors of oral sex.





Heads Up! Fellatio


Whether you think blowjobs are the mark of true love, to be doled out on special occasions, or not even real sex at all, you can’t deny that fellatio is having a cultural moment. (Or you might argue that a good blowjob has never gone out of style.) Our classes on the topic sell out, bachelorettes want to learn how to give rockin’ head, and you’re reading this now instead of watching erotic movies featuring, of course, blowjobs. There are techniques that will help hone your fellating skills—and there’s a knowledge base for those who are on the receiving end. Let’s start with the one who’s going down.





Giver


Remember, your tongue is smart. Sexually speaking, it might be the smartest part of your body. So basic and unsophisticated fellatio—the kind where somebody has a penis, somebody else has a mouth, and Person One approaches Person Two basically as an orifice—this train is not even going to stop at that station. We’re treating fellatio as a skill and as a sex act for both partners to enjoy sensually, not just because “Wow, look, I made you come!” That’s a fun part of sex, no doubt about it—the sense of power that comes from orchestrating an orgasm for someone else can be a fabulous high. But we think you deserve more, if you’re going to the trouble of facilitating an orgasm. So go back and read about the anatomy of the penis, if you need a refresher. Then, let’s dive in, or rather, on.

Many people treat blowjobs like a chore that they have to accomplish to get to a part of sex they like better: intercourse, maybe, or their own time under the tongue. And if the only blowjob experience you’ve ever had is “fucked in the face” style, you may have never experienced fellatio’s subtleties. Here’s the thing: Just as kissing can be an incredibly sensuous, sexy experience because so many nerve endings exist on and around your lips, on your tongue, and inside your mouth, so can giving oral sex be a sensuous, sexy experience, for exactly the same reasons. You just have to go slowly enough to stimulate your own body as well as the lucky person you’re fellating. Don’t just use your tongue to stimulate the penis—use the penis to stimulate your tongue. Tease, go slowly, and lick and suck in ways that make you feel good. Of course the person with the penis will feel good: A mouth is lavishing attention on some of the most sensitive parts of their body! Plus the experience of watching and feeling you enjoying yourself—not just doing oral sex, but genuinely loving what you’re doing—is a pleasure that no amount of just-go-through-the-motions fellatio can match. Take your time and explore. The most sensitive part of the penis is usually the head: also note the coronal ridge, the frenulum, and the foreskin (if still intact) are more richly endowed with nerve endings than the shaft. To get the most out of fellatio, focus your smart, slippery tongue in those areas—this will bear more erotic fruit than simply trying to stroke the shaft with your lips and tongue. Though this is also part of great fellatio technique (especially visually), it’s not the only part.

By the way, this type of pleasuring is especially useful if the person you’re going down on does not have an erection. So many people consider penile erection central to male sexuality—and even necessary to it—that when there’s no erection, it isn’t just intercourse that stops, it’s all sex. This is a shame, because you still have nerve endings regardless of whether you have an erection. (And, of course, some non-op and pre-op trans women don’t always, or ever, get erections, yet can still feel voluptuous pleasure if they are comfortable with a mouth on this part of their body.)

Performing fellatio on a soft or half-hard penis has certain charms, and for many blowjob-givers, it’s much easier to get into the sensuality of fellatio when the penis hasn’t yet become rigid. Try it and see. And while sometimes the “soft-on,” as the recipient of all this attention, will rapidly become hard, remember that for some people, an erection is unlikely: besides trans women who are affected by the hormones they take, some men with prostate issues lose the ability to get hard, and some medications (as well as some party drugs) make erections more difficult to achieve. This doesn’t mean the soft-on has no sensation, though, so go to it! BJs on soft cocks are also fun for the giver because you can fit more in your mouth, you feel powerful or just delighted when and if it does grow hard, and your ability to explore their (and your own) sensations can be front and center.

On the other hand, it is a pleasure in its own right to let loose and move: suck hard, take as much of the shaft in as possible, maybe even deep throat, and just go wild. Giving a blowjob can be a compelling and consuming experience for the giver as well as for the receiver. In a bit we’ll delve into deep throat technique.

But first, here’s a way to give your partner some of the intense sensation associated with deeper fellatio without activating the gag reflex: Use your hands! A combination hand and blowjob allows more pressure on the shaft than can be easily delivered by mouth alone. And if you’re going down on a person whose penis is too long to comfortably fit in your mouth, wrapping hands around the base of the shaft lets you control the depth of penile insertion. (For maximum sensation, lubricate your palms.) Simply handle the penis so that you are jacking him off but also using your lips and mouth, and you can add a lot to his erotic experience yet still be in control of your own body and how much you take in.



Pay close attention to the moves you make with mouth and tongue. Ask your partner what they like best, technique-wise, as you explore. Pointy hard tongue or soft and pillowy? A tongue that moves and wiggles like mad, or one that’s stationary while your lips do the stimulating? Penis in the mouth cavity, or between teeth and cheek? Some people even like a little teeth in their fellatio, but not everyone, and often this nibbling must be careful and subtle to be enjoyable. If you get the green light to add teeth, use your molars, not your sharper front teeth, for starters. And remember: Blowjobs with teeth are advanced, not beginner’s, technique.

Use your hands to touch any sensitive areas within reach. Even if your hands aren’t occupied with the penis, you can stroke, touch, and otherwise stimulate nipples, thighs, taint, a.k.a. perineum, testicles, anus, and elsewhere; depending on the position you’re in, you might be able to grab thighs or buttocks to further pull your partner to your mouth so you’re not constantly bobbing your head; or you can add sex toy stimulation with vibration or use anal toys.

Mix up your technique—you don’t have to do the exact same thing every time, unless your partner has really specific preferences. And by the way, how do you know what those preferences are? Ask!

Read our toy section if you want advice on adding in extra fun like cock rings. Rings can add sensation and sometimes make an erection firmer; the person giving head can put the cock ring on their partner as part of the play, or the receiver can come to the party already wearing one. Other sex toys­­—vibrators, penis sleeves, and so forth—can be brought in to the action to change up sensation or add novelty to the experience.

Some people love to experience anal play during oral sex, via their partner’s fingers or an anal plug or dildo. If your partner is one of them, have some gloves and wipes on hand to keep it all neat and clean; remember to never insert anything anally that doesn’t have a base; and check out our anal sex and anal toy sections for great information and ideas about stimulation.

If you’re a man giving fellatio to another man you might as well try the things you like best—maybe you’re blowjob twins! On the other hand, don’t assume that whatever tricks and sensations you like best are what he’ll prefer; he might like different techniques, so ask.

Positioning: As long as he doesn’t mind, put him wherever you want him, the place where you’re at your best while going at it and where you won’t end up with a case of lockjaw or a pressing need for a chiropractor. After all, that’s what he’ll most appreciate: you, in an optimal position to keep going as long as you like. Many men like to receive fellatio while standing, and while giving a blowjob from a kneeling position isn’t always easy on the knees, some feel more mobile this way than bending over a reclining partner. Whatever you do, pay attention to the way your head and neck are able to move. Especially if you get into vigorous motion, you can wind up with a sore neck if you ignore a comfortable position in favor of giving a rowdy blowjob. It’s your neck—take care of it.

Communicate clearly if you cannot have or don’t want your hair pulled or your head handled roughly or pushed around. If you are somewhere in the middle of the road on this question (or aren’t sure because you haven’t experienced various fellatio styles), you can figure this out together—see how your partner tends to move while getting head, how you respond to it, and negotiate accordingly. If hair-pulling or head-pushing is a strict limit or negative trigger for you, then just say so. You don’t have to give an explanation unless you want to: “Don’t pull my hair, please” works just fine. On the other hand, if you love having your face handled while giving a blowjob, encourage your partner to do it the way you like it; since it’s not everyone’s thing, some partners hesitate to do it in the first place unless you bring it up and give them permission.

Deep throating: This is not the only kind of head a person might ever want to give, and it may not even be the most pleasurable. But there’s no denying that burying as much of a sensitive penis into a warm, wet mouth as possible has big appeal. Most people are not natural deep-throaters; there are tricks and techniques to help you get better at it.

First of all, even if your partner is usually active during a blowjob, before your deep throat solo, tell them to let go of your ears and hold still. If they stop thrusting and moving, you can concentrate on learning technique. Take a look at the curvature of your partner’s penis. Your throat curves in a direction, too, and you want those curves to match. It may affect the direction from which you approach the penis—on some, you’ll have better results if you come from above and to one side. Slowly slide your mouth over the penis and let it enter you as deeply as possible; it helps to have a wet mouth for this, maybe even a bit of lube on the penis, and remember to slide along the tongue, not let your tongue curl up and block your throat. Pay attention to your breath. You’ll breathe in and breathe out; when you breathe in, let the penis in, and when you breathe out, slide off until the next breath. Practice this skill slowly at first, until, using your breath and the correct angle of entry, you’ve minimized your gag reflex as much as possible. Then, and only then, can you speed up, tell your partner to do some (careful) thrusting, and move toward a more natural rate of speed. If a too-fast or too-deep thrust throws you off, just pull off and stop for a bit, lingering at the cock head, until you’re ready to slide it in again.

By the way, the best time to do deep throat is not right after dinner. A full stomach plus the gag reflex is not most people’s idea of a good time. But speaking of dinner—anointing the penis with a slippery substance like olive oil can help you gulp it right down. Remember that if you’re giving a condomed blowjob, oil is not a safe choice and a silicone lube will probably work just as well—for the oral sex, if not for the pasta sauce.

Be clear about your safe sex standards when giving a blowjob. Perhaps that means condom use; or maybe no ejaculation in the mouth; or some other technique or restriction. Speaking of which, a blowjob is a great time to practice putting a condom on with your mouth. Try doing this when the penis is still soft; it’s a great party trick to start the blowjob with a soft-on, and finish with a condom-clad erection.

If you think using a condom with a blowjob is a drag, you just haven’t discovered the possibilities. Condoms have distinct benefits for oral sex, particularly when it comes to holding pre-cum and ejaculate. Porn, of course, often makes men’s ejaculate the starring player, and many people, including some blowjob-givers, eroticize it heavily; but the one receiving a stream of semen might not always think it’s so glorious—a condom takes care of that. Some people prefer to use condoms without a reservoir tip for deep-throating, since the little nipple at the end of the condom can tickle the back of the throat and make it harder to focus on taking in the full length. Remember to leave a little bit of condom empty to catch the ejaculate, though, or the condom will be more likely to break. Press the air out before the rubber goes on. For those who don’t like the taste of latex condoms, try the poly variety, which may also have a little less friction. And find a lube with a taste you like, flavored or not, since adding a little extra slipperiness helps offset the friction factor of the condom.





Receiver


You may not be aware of it, but there’s an art to getting a blowjob as well as giving one. Many guys think fellatio is nothing more than face-fucking, but for every fellator who does like this, there are many others who would just as soon never give head again if it means they have to put up with the rough stuff. If you’re a wild and crazy hair-puller or ear-grabber, you may or may not be getting as much head as you’d like, because some blowjob-givers plainly do not like that experience.





The Art of Receiving


Try lying back and letting your partner take the lead—this can be a different experience altogether, and you might find you get much more sensation and pleasure from this slower style of fellatio. If you have a fierce and frisky blowjob-giver on your hands, by all means let them do their thing, if you like it. You can even pay attention to which elements of their technique you like the best. But slow and sweet is a way to luxuriate in the journey and give your partner some time at the wheel.

It’s a balance—don’t just nap through this experience; excuse us for being direct, you don’t want to be a bore. If someone’s kind enough to slather your pleasure parts with their warm, wet mouth and tongue, engage with them. Express your pleasure verbally or physically.

Want to teach your partner what works best for you? Convey what you like, sexily. “Ooh, yeah, baby, I like ___”—fill in the blank and be specific. Tell her or him how wet you like it, how fast or slow, and especially if they are doing something you love. If, on the other hand, they are doing something you don’t like, a kind, “Oh, babe, that’s not working, try ___” can point your partner in a more successful direction. Don’t assume the person giving you head will do it exactly the way you like it the first time; fellatio can involve a wide variety of techniques, and some work well for some people, not so much for others.

If you’ve been taking your sexiness cues from adult movies, maybe you think it’s hot to growl, Yeeaaahhh, suck that cock. Maybe it is…it really is for some people…but not all. How about alternating that with, “Oh, you’re making my cock feel sooo good.” Porno talk can rock—except for those who think it’s the most trite turn-off they’ve ever heard. How about asking the person giving you head, “Is this kind of talk OK?”

Be complimentary. When you think about it, it’s pretty much an honor to get your dick sucked, isn’t it? Let them know you don’t take it for granted.

Be aware when you are thrusting hard and deeply, plus the duration of time this kind of vigorous technique lasts, since it can easily become too much for the giver to handle—enjoy yourself, but your partner does have to breathe—yes, even the ones who say, “Breathing is over-rated.” That is very sexy and gallant: what a keeper! But we advise you to let ’em breathe.

Are you going to come? Where? In their mouth, or somewhere else? We do wish you would decide this together before you start, but we are nothing if not practical, so we offer in-the-moment advice as well. Right before coming you can say, “Where do you want this load?” or “Where should I come?” if you haven’t negotiated this detail beforehand. This gives them a minute to breathe and tell you. Then you can say, “Show me how bad you want it there” to move the sexiness factor along; your ejaculation is now the big event, at least for the moment. Of course, it may be that your partner doesn’t want your big ol’ load on them at all—you can always catch it in your hand as you would while jacking off. Talk about gallant!





My Porno, My Professor


	If you’re like many people, you’ve watched porn movies not just for erotic entertainment, but for sexual inspiration and to learn how you might act during sex. And there is no doubt that these flicks feature plenty of fellatio scenes—often of the vigorous, even rough style. Did you know that there’s a very specific reason why this is the kind of blowjob you see? It’s because they’re more visual. There’s more movement for the camera to focus on. This is also why you don’t see lots of cunnilingus in erotic movies, compared to the overall blowjob quotient: Good cunnilingus is very hard to show, visually. And it might also be because men make most of the movies. If you were watching real cunnilingus it might appear to have no movement at all, because you can’t see the person’s tongue or the inside of their mouth. Yet in the movies, you observe Person A’s tongue extending as far out of their mouth as possible; this needs to happen so that the camera can show us that pointy tongue sweeping around. Extending and pointing your tongue can be a valid cunnilingus move—some people like it; it’s just that it’s not required, and it’s far from the only way to lick a clit. For some receivers, if it’s too pointy, it’s too much—too intense. Similarly, fellatio that is full of sensation for the receiver might involve little or no mouth and head movement, but lots of inside-the-mouth tongue action.

	 So don’t rely for all your erotic guidance on mythic, staged sex that’s designed to entertain. Porn is not sex education but rather inspiration for some. Remember that some cinematic sex styles have been specifically developed to give viewers something to watch, but this is not the same as feeling the erotic sensations in your body that a variety of sexual techniques, from gentle to vigorous, can evoke.





Going Down: Cunnilingus



“I got a taste of the real world (just a drop of it) when I went down on you, girl”

	—Jefferson Starship, “Miracles”





Cunnilingus is the two-dollar Latin name for oral sex performed on the vulva and clitoris, and it’s one of the best methods for clit-centric orgasm; remember, the tongue is smart, and you don’t need to write the alphabet with your tongue to prove it. Though maybe that is something you’ll want to try at least once.





Giver


When going down on a person with a vulva and clitoris, it’s crucial that you go slowly to start with; use pressure tentatively or gently at first; and inquire what your partner wants, making sure you clearly understand. “Knowing how the plumbing works” is never more relevant than in this department: Many a man has approached a pussy with all the intensity he’d want an eager lover to use in going down on him. And this isn’t only an issue for male-female couples; every person with a clit and every lover learns this dance anew. For all our talk of similar sex organs and empathetic sex, remember that no two of us are exactly alike, either, so this is one area where you may need to check in and get direction until you know how the particular vulva and clitoris in front of you responds.

Some women absolutely love it when you jump in ferociously and attack their bits with a hard mouth and passionate intensity—and they should tell you so. But for those who don’t, by the time the recipient of this fierce licking can pull a partner up for a breath, she might already feel badly for not liking what you are doing; she may have already crossed over into that internal conversation in which she ponders faking that she likes it, since she sees you’re so eager to keep licking. For your part, you may be bringing all the enthusiasm to the task that you appreciate when you’re the one getting head. This certainly doesn’t happen to everyone, but we bring it up so we can help readers avoid this situation.

This is a balance: If you don’t seem happy to go down, and she happens to be someone who worries about her ability to respond and come—some women never worry about this, but others certainly do—your oral lovemaking can turn into a dance of insecurity. She may start off worried: whether she’ll like it, what she’ll do if she isn’t quick to respond, whether you’ll enjoy her taste and smell, how long it will take her to come, what she’ll say if she needs to give you feedback, and how you’ll take it if she does speak up. Especially if she’s into you, the moment she knows you’re heading south might light off all these fears. Ironically, cunnilingus might touch off both partners’ insecurities, since one reason some people are reluctant to engage in this delightful erotic pastime is their fear of not doing it well. So, if you’re going to go down at all, be glad you’re there, show that you are ready, eager and willing, but not so eager that you miss physical cues or fail to hear verbal feedback. Yes, her thighs are right on your ears, but listen up! Go slowly and ask what she likes and wants.

The best way to start going down on a vulva and clit is to make the person convinced that it turns you on more than anything. Many women think this is too intimate an act, may be hesitant because of body insecurity or feelings of intense vulnerability—it helps to exude your desire to serve her pleasure and assist in a deeper orgasmic experience—that the smell and taste of her is all you think about. Start around the thighs or belly; with hands putting pressure on her and lifting her towards you, use your tongue and mouth to kiss her pussy slowly and languidly. Work up to a quicker pace as her arousal increases, licking her inner labia for a long period of time delicately until she encourages you back to her clit—by now, you will likely be able to offer stronger sensations. Do pay attention to any non-verbal cues, from face-grabbing to grinding harder on you to pushing you subtly away.

Let’s back up a bit and recap the way most women experience arousal, genitally speaking. The blood flows to the genitals and results in two important physiological changes: It starts vaginal juices flowing—varying amounts for different individuals—and it causes the genitals to engorge, erect, and become cushioned with blood. This process also affects the way the nerves transmit sensation. Before arousal has had time to work its magic and make the vulva all cushy and the clitoris erect, direct pressure on this area doesn’t always feel erotic, or even especially good. If arousal hasn’t chemically affected the genitals and too-fast or too-hard touch has evoked irritation, it will be difficult, or sometimes impossible, to work through that response and back into heightened arousal. This is the reason touch, whether with the hands or the tongue, should start out gentle, tentative, or soft and you should start away from the clitoris and zero in on it gradually: if you go past the comfort level associated with her degree of arousal, you might not get a chance to backtrack. If you do sync up with her arousal process, you may find that as her turn-on increases, the closer to orgasm she gets, the more she wants stronger pressure, possibly a faster stroke, and other sensations that she didn’t respond to earlier in her sexual response cycle. In other words, if you start out lighter, by the time she gets really turned on, she may want much more intense sensation.



What a difference arousal makes—from “I want to kill you for starting out too hard,” to the grand finale where I’m slamming your mouth into my pubic bone!





How do you know whether you’re doing it right? Ask. You can also tune in to body language: Is she grabbing your head and pushing her vulva in your direction, adding pressure to whatever you’re doing? Then up the pressure! Is she scooting backwards up the bed? Lighten up! One caveat about body language: Some women have a history of faking pleasure rather than speaking up to say they aren’t aroused. In general, this is not helpful to the cunnilinguist who wants to become great at it. The woman who fakes it wants her partner to feel good and to think they are doing a great job. Unfortunately, with this strategy the faker ends up teaching the giver to do things that don’t in fact work. When we say “pay attention to body language,” we mean more than responding to her sounds and sexy movements. Look up her body: Has her breathing changed and become deeper, or is she holding it? Can you tell if she has a sex flush or blush that covers her chest? Either of these can be hard-to-fake signs that she’s in the sexual response cycle for real; sometimes people also curl or stretch out their toes, clutch the sheets or your hair, and arch their back involuntarily.

In some cases, when you ask for feedback or directions, she won’t be used to giving verbal information and it’ll be hard for her to do; however, whether or not she’s comfortable being directive, she will hear that you care about her experience.





Tips and Techiniques


First, stimulate something else before getting to her pussy: kiss and stroke, fondle or grasp, but don’t home in on the clit and vulva before other arousal-provoking activities have begun—unless your partner asks you to. Give attention from breasts downward and thighs upward, from buttocks around to the front: let the genital area anticipate direct contact before you give it.





The Clit Is Not a Doorbell


While it’s absolutely true that the clitoris is a significant center of sexual sensitivity, that doesn’t mean it’s a magic button, and all you have to do is press it. It isn’t a doorbell!



A cunnilingus technique that often misses the mark is to focus too hard, too soon, on the clitoris. Clitoral stimulation is as important to cunnilingus as penile stimulation is to fellatio—but it’s not always as direct. For some, it has to be entirely indirect for starters—direct contact is just too intense. This may always be true for some women, who just can’t take direct stimulation against the clit. For others, direct on the clitoris is OK, but with a soft tongue, not a hard, pointed one. Many women do not like you going up under the hood—the clitoral hood, that is, which some cunnilinguists will retract in order to give very direct clitoral stimulation. This, too, may be too much. Rule of thumb: If she hasn’t asked you to do that, don’t.

You can ask her to tell you if it becomes too much; some women won’t speak up unless you give that permission, so please do. You can listen for sounds of intense response that don’t sound like cries of pleasure. And you can pay attention to body language, as discussed earlier.

The degree of wetness you encounter or create during cunnilingus is important for some women. Too wet, either from their own vaginal juices or from their partner’s saliva, and it can feel drippy or distracting, or there’s not enough friction to please them. Do you salivate when you go down? Some people do, either because they like cunnilingus so much or because salivary response is evoked by oral contact and movement. Too dry, and it can be irritating. We usually think of lubricant as necessary for insertion, but once in a while, it’s good to use it during oral sex, too—you can try a kind that tastes good to you, or is at least neutral.

Most women like to be licked on one side or the other of the clitoris, or toward the front or back—they have a “sweet spot” of sensation that gets them happy faster, or is necessary for them to orgasm. If she can’t tell you just where hers is, ask her to show you where she touches her clit and vulva when she masturbates. Technique-wise, then, start with stimulation of the area around the clitoris before you home in; when you do, start gently, with a soft rather than hard tongue, and let her know she can tell you (verbally or through body language like holding your face and pulling you in) when to be more focused, intense, fast, or whatever kind of escalation she likes, such as adding a finger or two inside her vagina. Not all women like this; others can only come this way; and many like being filled during or immediately after orgasm.

Let’s talk pubic hair. We write this at a moment in history when a lot of women are trimming or shaving, and the vulva is often totally or relatively shorn of hair—another sex fad influenced, though probably not created by, sexy pictures and films because again, it supports the visual needs of these media. But it is also a practice that supports cunnilingus, by removing or minimizing the hair that might otherwise get in the way—and between your teeth, and in the back of your throat—and also by allowing the receiver of oral pleasuring to feel sensation unimpeded by a fringe of fur. Pubic hair does grow on most adults, though, and some people even fetishize it, so if you encounter it, you can smooth it away with your fingers to get a clearer shot at the clitoris, and/or pull on it gently to add sensation.

Did you notice we didn’t tell you to use a flat tongue or a pointy one? Did you notice we didn’t say to only use your lips or open your mouth? That’s because it all depends on the person you are going down on. You will just have to do your individual homework, and have fun doing it!

How long does it take? If you have a good lover their response might be “It could take forever, sweetheart! What else would I rather be doing?”

So suave! In reality, coming can take widely varying amounts of time, from a few minutes to over an hour. So if you’re going to settle in for the yummy cunnilingus long haul—get comfortable!





Receiver


Oh, to be the recipient of a delightful tongue bath—just lie back and enjoy, right? Sometimes we can get in our own way, so we realize you might be reading this because you’d like some help in that department, and we will oblige. But we have another message for you, too: You are an active participant in this lovely sex act, and you can communicate your desires at all times through your body language. Remember that lying back while someone goes down on you is not necessarily a passive thing at all! You can grab at your lover’s hair or touch and guide their face to make contact against your clitoris lighter, or push them down to signal for more pressure, bucking or grinding against their face. It just depends on how much sensation you want and how turned on you’re getting.

If you already have some experience as the recipient of cunnilingus, you might know about some of the sensations that work best for you; please do not require this nice person in your bed to read your mind. There are verbal, as well as nonverbal, ways to convey information to them. Please do give them a road map for your pleasure! We want to encourage you to communicate what you like as directly as you can. You might say:

	 I love a flat tongue on my clit

Oooh, a more tickly tongue, please!

Here’s my sweet spot right here (and rub your finger on the side of your labia or clit or whatever it is that you love)

This side of my clit is the most sensitive

Please go real slow at first

Harder, please, harder!



For some people, being patient—as long as you aren’t irritated or disliking something—works. You might start out feeling simple pleasure, and if you can relax into the sensations for a while, you may find yourself soon thoroughly engaged. If this describes you—not writhing around and moaning in ecstasy, perhaps, but definitely enjoying yourself—be sure to let your partner know that although you are quiet, you love the feelings they are evoking in you. A simple “This is really nice” or “I know I am quiet but I am so blissed out” or just a heartfelt “Ohhh yes yes yes” will tell your lover they’re doing you right and encourage them to keep on keepin’ on bringing you pleasure.



What else do you respond well to during oral sex? Do you want a hand reaching up and grabbing or fondling your breasts? Do you like being stroked on your ass or sides or thighs while someone’s going down on you? How about fingers slid inside while someone’s licking you, either vaginally or anally? Some women like oral sex when it’s combined with bondage or other kinky play, or enhanced with sex toys like Kegel balls, a small vibrator, or other tools of stimulation like dildos or anal beads.

If you know you like any of that—or even if you just like the idea of it—ask for it!

Be prepared for G-spot pleasure to ensue if enhanced-with-fingers cunnilingus gets intense; many women (and trans guys) and their partners have learned that ejaculation and orgasm can happen from this position. We didn’t say what precise physical position you have to be in for cunnilingus-plus-fingers, because some will be more comfy on their bellies lying between their lover’s legs, others kneeling while they sit on the sofa—you decide what feels best for your body. Some years back a study showed that lesbians and bisexual women were more likely to ejaculate and have G-spot orgasms than other women. We suspect it’s because these are the most likely partners to do cunnilingus and add two fingers in the vagina to stimulate vagina and G-spot.

Some do not come easily during oral sex, for a variety of reasons. It’s still a lovely, sexy thing to experience, but maybe it’s just not the way you generally get to orgasm, or maybe orgasm eludes you a lot of the time. But if you get worried they are going to lick you forever, we have a couple of suggestions to give you an alternative to stopping them abruptly and bruising their ego, or feeling like you have to fake it. Simply pull your partner up from between your legs and guide them to another sexy activity. If you want to tell them you often don’t come this way, you can—though some lovers might take that as a personal challenge. You can moan lasciviously or talk dirty when you request them to move the action to another erotic act or another part of your body, and who could resist a sexy request like that?





Fear of smell or taste


Many people have heard that vaginal juice is nasty or smelly, that female genitals don’t taste good, and this rumor enhances fear of cunnilingus for both the licker and the lick-ee. The lick-ee is too worried about her smell or taste to relax and get turned on; she stays up in her head and can’t respond. The potential licker wants to please their partner, but is scared to go down. In reality, a healthy vagina’s juices are more likely to be a turn-on, at least if the person practices good hygiene. Remember that many people love love love their lover’s flavors and smell. No less a paramour than Napoleon reportedly wrote to Josephine, “Home in three days. Don’t wash!”





Come Hither: Let Your Fingers Do The…


Fingers are just about the best erotic appendages on our bodies. They can transmit a variety of sensations between partners, as well as during solo sex, from light and feathery to intense, deep pressure. They can be skillful instruments of pleasure in and of themselves, or create heightened cravings for more. You can start with one finger and work up from there if more are desired. Fingers can curve, grasp, and feel, locating all the right spots. Many a lesbian knows the fine art of digital manipulation and the screams of pleasure those digits can bring forth. If someone designed a dildo possessing all the skills of a set of fingers, it would represent extreme innovation.



We often hear from men with erectile issues, or their partners, that they turn away from sex, thinking they can’t bring pleasure without a hard penis, but if these guys would just learn the amazing capabilities of their fingers, they’d be inspired to get back into the game!





Sensational Fingers


While some people might have a preference for rough hands, and long fingernails can create delicious sensations upon the skin, when it’s time for genital touch, more tender mucous membranes call for trimmed nails and hangnails and, if hands are still quite rough, a glove.





Take the Long Way Around the Block


If you take your time getting down to genital business, it might be to your advantage—especially if your partner is a vulva/vagina/clitoris-endowed person. It’s generally not the best idea to rush your fingers right in without first using your hands and mouth for overall stimulation. Don’t forget that the skin is our largest sex organ! Whether the person you’re seeking to pleasure loves light, sensual touch or fierce squeezes, or first one, then the other, their arousal will build and your fingers will feel that much better to them when they finally slip below the belt.





Choose Your Lube


Even though many vaginas are happy to greet you, proving how much by how wet they get, and many penises will stand up and salute, you can’t bet that your honey’s genitals will directly signal their arousal and readiness for more. Have some lube on hand. Slippery fingers on sensitive pleasure parts add to the stimulation—slick vs. dry fingers almost make for two different sex acts. This is especially, but not solely, true for insertion play.





One Little Digit Went to Market


Many savvy lovers recommend that you don’t even attempt vaginal or anal entry until your partner has had an orgasm. Others build desire via external touch, until their partner begs them to slide their fingers in. Still others know that some partners are much more likely to come if they feel a sense of fullness. Whatever your partner’s preferences, start with one finger, learn the terrain, add another, and continue as desired. One person’s perfect level of fullness is two fingers, while another’s is four. Your mission is to learn their perfect experience, finger-banging-wise.





More Bang for Your Buck


And why is it called “finger-banging,” you may ask? It sounds a little rowdy! Well, it can be, with a highly aroused partner. As the vagina balloons and the anus relaxes into pleasure, in some cases you can finger-fuck with a good deal of speed and vigor. In many cases (though not all—pay attention!) the fingers don’t even extend to the end of the vagina and don’t strike the cervix; if they don’t, you don’t have to worry about any pain with cervical contact, and the palm of the hand or the place where the fingers meet the palm gives extra stimulation as they reach the clitoris or the perineum.





Curve Ball


Don’t forget the curved fingers that best stimulate G-spot and prostate! No savvy finger penetration is complete without it—unless, that is, it’s a sensation that your partner doesn’t enjoy. We don’t call it the “Come hither” motion for nothing!





Do You Want More?


We saved whole hand penetration for our More Ways to Have Sex section. Skip ahead if you must!





The G-Spot


Billing it as a mysterious explosive pleasure spot makes some women and trans guys feel they are missing something if they haven’t found their G-spot, but it’s simply an area of our anatomy that some report as pleasurable when stimulated. Did that answer the titillating “What is a G-Spot?” question? No? Oh, you want to know more? Okay, here we go.

The G-spot, or Gräfenberg Spot, is named after the German gynecologist who first “discovered” it. It’s an area of spongy erectile tissue that surrounds the urethra and can be found in some women by inserting a finger into the vagina and curving it towards the navel. Both women and trans men have this tissue, though no one knows for sure whether all women and trans men do, and FTM guys in particular may use different anatomical terms and choose to stimulate it differently. Other scientific names for it are periurethral sponge and prostata femina.





Did You Know?


	The G-spot has many names—including periurethral sponge, the Prostata Femina, Goddess Spot, Girl Spot, Sacred Spot, and She Spot.



For some, prolonged stimulation of the G-spot can result in orgasm, and sometimes ejaculation—or, more correctly, emission. However, there are many women for whom prolonged or even minimal pressure to the G-spot feels uncomfortable or irritating, and others for whom it feels much the same as other types of vaginal stimulation. While there is no magic button on a woman’s body that will instantly produce arousal or orgasms, some women who enjoy G-spot stimulation have described their climaxes as “full-bodied” and “mind-blowing”—so exploring it might be worth a try, if you like vaginal insertion and feel like going hunting.





How Can I Find It?


Searching with a Co-Pilot


Many people find it helpful to have someone else locate their G-spot for simply physiological reasons—since it’s inside the body, it’s not that easy to reach on your own. The G-spot is usually easier to find when you are aroused, since this causes the spongy tissue to swell, making the G-spot area somewhat firmer than the surrounding vaginal walls. Many find it irritating to seek and stimulate their G-spots when they are not turned on. So first things first: Enjoy your time physically touching, having oral sex, masturbating, doing whatever gets the motor revved up before you start your search.

Instructions for the G-spot hunter: No, you don’t need a spelunker’s helmet, but a sexy look on your face and an adventurous attitude helps.

So you took care of step one, listed above: Everyone is turned on. To locate the G-spot, apply lubricant to your fingers: usually the index and middle fingers work fine—just use one finger if the vagina you’re searching isn’t into girth. Insert the fingers, curled and making a “come hither” motion so that they are pressing towards the navel. This is also known as urethral stimulation, as it is the track of the urethra that two fingers slide to either side of. If the receptive partner is on her back, curl your fingers upwards. If she’s on her stomach or hands and knees, curl your fingers down. If the vaginal opening were a clock with the clitoris at noon, the G-spot would be located between 11:00 and 1:00—right below the clit, essentially. The G-spot is generally two or three inches inside the vagina.



See if she likes the “come hither” motion. Or she might like circles, pressure, or back and forth like a windshield wiper. Go slowly, and don’t try everything at once. She may also like different sensations or different levels of intensity as her arousal builds. Try combining G-spot stimulation with clitoral stimulation—maybe she wants to touch her clit with her fingers or a vibrator, maybe you want to go down on her or use your other hand. Try a few different things and ask her what she likes best. Or, perhaps afterward, have her rate them on a scale of 1-10 to give you information about what worked for her. Remember, this search is most successful and pleasurable when she’s turned on, so you might not want to get too clinical right in the moment. Remember too that it is not known conclusively whether everyone will respond to even the savviest G-spot hunting. There’s no absolute guarantee that this search will uncover a new erogenous zone—that makes it doubly important that the search itself is pleasurable!

When the G-spot is stimulated, some may initially feel an urge to urinate, but this should lessen as stimulation continues. If this sensation makes you nervous, try urinating prior to getting started, and lie on a towel as you begin to explore. Keep reading to learn about female ejaculation.





Did You Know?


The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality, by Alice Kahn Ladas, Ed.D., Beverly Whipple, Ph.D., and John D. Perry, Ph.D. was published in 1982.





Finding Your Own G-spot


Some women and trans guys can indeed reach inside themselves to find the G-spot, but most find it easier to do so with a toy—particularly one specifically designed for G-spot sensations. Since the G-spot is generally much more responsive to pressure than light touches, these toys have a pronounced curve and are hard or very firm, which makes them easier to angle or press against the G-spot. In addition, many people find that vibrators, dildos, or Kegel balls make solo G-spot stimulation easier.





Women Ejaculating


During G-spot stimulation, many experience a rush of clear fluid (which is not urine) from the urethra during intense arousal or orgasm. For some, “female ejaculation” happens spontaneously during sex, without their control or effort. (It probably goes without saying that most trans men call it something else.) For others, female ejaculation is something that they teach their body to do. Many women who do ejaculate naturally have tried to hold back their ejaculations out of embarrassment or because they’ve mistaken it for urination. To those women we say, ejaculation is a gift. Let your fluids flow!

What is Female Ejaculate Made Of? Female emission is a clear fluid that actually has chemical similarities to the prostatic fluid found in men, and is created and stored in the periurethral glands. This fluid is released through the urethra, which has led many people to confuse ejaculate with urine, but tests on the fluid have revealed a different chemical composition. The amount of female ejaculate can vary but some have estimated up to two tablespoons (30 cc’s) of fluid.

Author, filmmaker and educator Deborah Sundahl popularized the term “Female Ejaculate” as a description for women squirting G-spot fluid. She also discovered that the speculum doctors use actually covers up the G-spot, so it’s ironic that so many doctors say they “can’t find it”!



How Does a Woman Achieve Ejaculation? Since the PC muscles help push fluids through the urethra, learning how to relax and contract the muscles may also help release fluid from your body. Another reason to do your Kegel exercises! It is possible, though less common, for women to achieve female ejaculation through clitoral stimulation alone, without internal vaginal stimulation.

Some women’s G-spots are ready to emit fluid as soon as they are aroused. Many women have to be more highly aroused, along with having their G-spot stimulated for a long time.

How Does It Feel? How Do I Know? Let’s say you have been having sex for a while and are super turned on; your partner’s fingers, penis or a G-spot toy is intensely stimulating. Now you feel pressure—it may feel something like the need to pee. That’s the feeling that ejaculation might be imminent. A G-spot orgasm might produce a spurt or gush of fluid (or even just a trickle); some find that bearing down at that moment when climaxing may result in ejaculate as well. You might choose to pull out anything inside you, like a dildo or Kegel balls, right as orgasm starts, which can sometimes provoke ejaculation, or your body might push everything out—toy, fingers, etc.—as you come because the orgasm’s first contraction is so strong.

Ejaculating may be easier in certain positions, like with your hips higher than your head, or on all fours—though not everyone has this experience. You can pile up your bedroom pillows and see if that does the trick. Some sex positioning pillows are designed to give support, have machine-washable covers and are made with the right angle for G-spot play. Plus, they make it easier to combine G-spot play and oral sex with no backache.

Other Useful Tips

Worrying about whether or not you will ejaculate is a sure way to throw yourself off (just like worrying about an orgasm), so make sure you’re in a comfortable place and don’t pressure yourself. If it happens, great. If not, don’t stress about it and just enjoy the sensation.

Clitoral stimulation usually adds to G-spot stimulation and might help get your ejaculate flowing, so always listen to your body and do what feels good. Not only does this bring its own rewards, but it might turn out to be just the thing to set your fluids free.

If you are worried about accidentally urinating while relaxing and contracting the PC muscles, create a space for yourself that will let you explore your body in peace. If placing towels beneath you, or even moving your exploits into a bathroom, gives you the freedom to let yourself go, then do it. Trying anything new for the first time, especially when it involves your body, can seem embarrassing or even a little scary; what matters most is that you make yourself as comfortable as possible and try to enjoy what the experience has to offer.

Seeing is believing: If you enjoy watching your education, please take a look at the video GUSH: The Official Guide to the G-spot & Female Ejaculation—featuring our own Dr. Carol.



So grab your partner, your fingers, or your favorite G-spot toy and start exploring. You might even realize that female ejaculation is something you’ve done before. And if female ejaculation just doesn’t seem to happen for you, at least you’ll have fun trying.

And remember, these pleasures are optional, not required for a happy sex life. There is no scientific indication so far that all women can ejaculate or have G-spot orgasms; if you become obsessed with having this experience, you can, ironically, focus so much on it that your body shuts down and won’t do it. Relax and enjoy sex: that raises your chance of a G-spot orgasm or ejaculation.





Sexual Intercourse: The Big Bang Theory? Or Practice!


Are you thinking, “What is there to know about intercourse? Just stick it in, right?” Most sex educators don’t give a special class on intercourse—even they seem to think not much needs to be said about this most “natural” of erotic options. But we think that intercourse—penis/vagina sex, dildo/vagina sex, the ol’ in-and-out—is perfectly deserving of our attention. We’ll get to penis/anus and dildo/anus too, if that sounds more like your favorite kind!

Maybe you’ve had great intercourse and maybe you’ve had bad intercourse—or maybe just meh intercourse. Since we are taught to think of it as the very definition of sex, it’s presumed that intercourse is as natural as sneezing. The human race did have to figure it out, of course, but we would like to help if you want to make your experience of intercourse even better.

Some people don’t like intercourse, which can lead to them thinking they don’t like sex at all. In fact, you can love sex and not be into fucking; there is, as we have said many times, way more to sex than in-and-out. Yet the concept of intercourse, penis in vagina, is so foundational in our culture, and in most other cultures: It’s the only thing that counts if you’re identifying as a virgin or not, the only thing that seemingly matters to define everything from true-love sex to adultery.

We’re going to mess with the definition of intercourse a little bit by discussing both the classic kind, that is, penis-vagina sex, and also strap-on dildo sex. They’re not the same, but since both experiences are similar regarding arousal, orgasm, positions, and other specifics, we’ll address them together. To be honest, one reason we’re doing this is to destabilize the notion that “intercourse is real sex because it’s heterosexual.” We think intercourse is real sex because it can be excellent, and this “real sex” business limits our acceptance of sexual variation and, hence, many people and their pleasure…maybe even yours. So let’s set aside those definitions for now, and just get busy having fun.

Here are some absolutely vital pieces of information about intercourse.

We’ve already discussed arousal; please refer back to that section if it’s not fresh in your mind, because one extremely important element that determines whether intercourse is pleasurable and successful—vs. boring or even painful—is whether the participants are aroused. Arousal level may seem like a no-brainer when it comes to the penis part of the “penis/vagina sex” definition, but remember, strap-on sex counts too—a person with a penis that isn’t erect can still have intercourse using a dildo. And lack of an erection in a penis does not necessarily mean lack of arousal; the person may be plenty turned on, just not getting hard for one of many common reasons.

The person with the vagina also needs to be aroused, which is often thought of, in a kind of shorthand, as wet. “Are you wet?” “Oh, you’re so wet!” But it’s possible for someone to want intercourse, or other vaginal insertion, without being wet at all—that is, without a lot of juicy vaginal secretions. It is also possible for someone to be wet and not want to have intercourse, so wetness itself—like penile erection—is not the only determining factor. Wetness is not permission to enter a vagina, either, unless the person attached to the vagina says it is.

There are at least two factors to consider before you start: First, are you ready for intercourse? Let’s consider what that might mean. Partly it’s relevant to the question of arousal. If either partner doesn’t desire intercourse, it’s likely they won’t be sufficiently aroused to proceed. Just wanting to please a partner who does want intercourse generally isn’t enough, although we’ll discuss ways in which even this situation can be made into a better, hotter experience for the one who wants to please their partner.

Also, there’s the question not of whether you’re “ready for intercourse” in the moment, but “ready” in the big-picture context. First intercourse is considered equivalent, at least for females, with virginity loss. Virginity is still important in some communities, subcultures, and families. Some people just want to “save” their first experience for someone special: the person one is going to marry, or a first love, or someone who’s trusted or exceptional in some other way. For others, however, ending virginity is just one step on life’s path; it doesn’t carry the same weight as falling in love or getting hitched. Which are you—an “Intercourse is sooo special” person, or a “Let’s just do this thing!” person? And of course you might be a little of both.

Safer sex decisions are mandatory. Penis/vagina intercourse is associated with pregnancy, so another question to consider regarding readiness is to ask whether you both know about contraception, can access it, and are prepared for that level of responsibility should contraception fail. This is one of several reasons there’s a legal age at which people can consent to intercourse. P/V sex is also associated with many sexually transmitted conditions; this means safer sex is part of the mix when we make decisions about having intercourse, and how we have it—protected or bareback.

Penis-in-vagina sex usually requires a certain degree of wetness for comfort, as we’ve said, and lubricant can enhance it; for safe condomized sex, it’s a must-have. The lubricant makes it more comfortable for the insertee, plus protects the condoms against friction-induced breakage. So—are you ready for intercourse? If you have lube on hand, perhaps you are.

Much has been said about orgasm and intercourse, partly because intercourse seems to be a more effective way for men to come than women; but this can obscure the fact that many guys don’t come during intercourse either. Some research suggests that around 70% of women rarely or never come during intercourse, because it’s not a very efficient way to stimulate the clitoris. Some women come easily through vaginal insertion, others never do, and whether that’s because they don’t get aroused enough during intercourse or because they’re not wired for vaginal orgasm isn’t always clear. But if you are seeking an orgasm, the more aroused the better. Many people do a simple thing that adds greatly to the chances that a woman will come during intercourse: They add clitoral stimulation, either via a vibrating cock ring, one or the other partner’s hand, or a vibrator, between their bodies, or they use positions that allow for extra clitoral contact. Some people believe that women’s orgasm during intercourse is associated with the size of their partner’s penis; while some women do have a size preference—which may be smaller or larger, depending—there’s no indication that bigger is always better as far as coming is concerned. Lots of people with penises worry about their size, when in fact size is rarely the most important variable in pleasing a partner during intercourse, and often it isn’t important at all.

Another myth is that a woman will come if intercourse goes on long enough; while short-duration intercourse doesn’t provide enough stimulation for many women, if a woman isn’t already turned on enough when intercourse begins, longer thrusting will not generally get her there. How turned on she is before intercourse starts may be the single most important factor orgasm-wise. Learning this could be a relief to a male partner worried about the duration of his erection.

All this adds up to one thing: turn-on! Which may mean that you don’t start intercourse for quite some time, after you begin to have sex, engage in sex play, or whatever you’d like to call it. Remember, we discourage you from thinking intercourse = sex. That disrespects all the other wonderful sexual activities we can do for pleasure.

You might have noticed that we don’t use the word “foreplay” much; that, too, implies that intercourse is the main event, whereas for lots of people that isn’t true. By re-naming foreplay “turn-on activities,” we can call them out as the fabulous and sometimes crucial erotic experiences they are.

Now, it’s possible for someone to want intercourse so much—to be turned on by the thought of it, by fantasies, by being hot for their partner—that they are ready to go for it right away. This is the situation when people have a quickie—a good quickie, that is. Tearing each other’s clothes off and getting right to it is sexy when fueled by a high level of desire, and there may need to be no oral sex, no feeling up, no sex toys, no nothing: just a growl of passion and a trail of discarded clothes, plus possibly an empty lube sample packet and a condom in a nearby trash can.

But this is not the way most intercourse happens, even if most intercourse is quick—as surveys suggest it is. Much intercourse doesn’t seem like two people mutually devouring each other, erotically speaking, but rather one person more motivated and turned on than the other. And this is where turn-on activities (a.k.a. “foreplay”) can make a huge difference. We’ve already discussed these in other sections—hand jobs, cunnilingus, fellatio, kissing and more. Study up and explore these fine erotic arts! Combined with communication, lubrication, and a partner who is sexually comfortable, these are ingredients that can facilitate and improve intercourse for young people just getting started, older people whose bodies and responses have changed, and those in the middle who don’t get aroused at the drop of a hat.





Technique


Let’s say arousal isn’t in question: You’re both hot to trot. What about size? A turned-on vagina is flexible and can expand to match a thicker penis or dildo, as you’ll recall from our discussion of anatomy. However, there’s one definite intercourse situation in which size does matter, and that has to do more with length than girth. Sometimes the penis (or longer dildo) contacts the cervix during intercourse in a way that can be uncomfortable or painful. Not everyone with a cervix experiences this, but some definitely do, and certain physical conditions, like Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), can make pain and discomfort much more likely. The harder the penis or dildo and the deeper and more vigorous the thrust, the worse it is.

Years ago, Carol spoke to a young man who had a problem and worried it was due to the size of his penis. He went to a small college and at the beginning of the term, he’d had no trouble getting dates, but as the semester went on, fewer and fewer women would go out with him, and those that did wouldn’t have sex with him even though he was an attractive guy with a larger-than-average-sized penis. He thought they were telling each other not to do it with him. Carol asked him what happened when he realized he was with a woman who was up for intercourse and what he did when he was about to enter her vagina. “Do you just go for it? Do you thrust right in?” “Well, yeah,” he said, as if that was the only possible answer to a fairly stupid question. But remember, this guy was big—over ten inches long, he said. “You can never just ram it in ever again,” Carol advised him, “unless a woman tells you that’s definitely what she wants. You have to go slowly.”

We hope that guy became the penis version of that great old Pointer Sisters song, “Slow Hand,” because if he did, he’s probably seen some high-quality action since college. His dilemma illustrates a lot about intercourse technique.

Big Penis Man, in his eagerness to get into a welcoming vagina, actually canceled out his welcome almost at once by ramming it in right away. It probably felt great to him. To his female partners, it hurt. It hurt so much that not only did they never have sex with him again, they even warned their friends away from him.

Advising this guy to start slowly is part of the solution to his dilemma; partners who are comfortable enough to tell him to wait, and are communicative about their needs, are another part of the solution. And lube! But when the penis or dildo slides in gradually—especially if erotic activities are also going on like kissing, eye contact, “dirty” talk, breast play, and clitoral stimulation—it can be extremely erotic. In addition, it allows the person entering the other’s vagina to gauge how deep their partner likes to be penetrated. Slow intercourse can be a delight for both partners, helping the partner who’s “catching” to warm to the sensation and build up a desire for more—length, speed of thrusts, depth, intensity; it’s also crucial to help the “pitcher” understand how fast/deep/intensely they can thrust into the “catcher” without causing discomfort or pain.

Another intercourse variable is the G-spot; for those whose urethral sponge is sensitive, some intercourse experiences can provide added pleasure. It’s important to stress, however, that all pleasure with intercourse is not G-spot-derived; that those without sensitive G-spots often love intercourse just as much as those who have them; and even that some people who do love G-spot play don’t get the stimulation from intercourse they need to be G-responsive, but derive G-fun from fingers or toys.

Mostly, during intercourse a penis or dildo slides right on by the G-spot, but a short one may give more direct G-spot stimulation; positions might affect this, too, which we’ll explore in the Positions section.

If someone is going to get G-spot delights from intercourse, it will likely happen with a penis or dildo that is either quite curved (most penises are curved, but usually not as much as direct G-spot stimulation requires), or that has a prominent head. The edge of the head, a.k.a. the coronal ridge, can be a great friend to the G-spot, but this feature varies among penises and is not always especially prominent. And a few styles of sex toy are designed to maximize G-spot and clitoral stimulation during intercourse; they are U-shaped and actually fit inside the vagina and curve around to contact the clit too, with enough room for a penis to slide in as well. As a bonus, they might add to the experience of a couple whose penis/vagina fit could use a little extra stimulation.

Another technique issue: Everyone has their own preferences re: depth, speed, movement, gentleness, intensity—we’ve already discussed some of these variations. As partners become comfortable with each other, and as individuals get comfortable with their own experience of intercourse and can start paying attention to variations among partners, if they’ve had more than one, tuning in or asking about preferences is crucial. It really is easiest to ask. Trying to assess people’s arousal path and orgasm readiness might seem easy in a demonstrative person, unless they are faking, but some people become quiet and internal when they’re actually hugely turned on and about to come. To the person schooled in porn—which, remember, is not an especially fact-based school—or inexperienced in the ways of these silent orgasms, their partner might seem unengaged or cold; the fire burns brightly within, but with the naked eye, you don’t see the flames.

So: Talk!





Simultaneous orgasm


Simultaneous orgasm is thought of as a peak experience by some, and it can be fabulous. But many couples pursue it relentlessly, and evaluate the success of their sex life by whether or not they have it; this tends to make an otherwise good sex life seem inadequate. Other partners find that having orgasms at the same time makes it harder, not easier, to enjoy their own and their companion’s orgasm, because, as with oral 69, trying for simultaneous orgasm can distract both partners from the pleasure they might otherwise feel. There is absolutely nothing wrong with both of you enjoying whatever you are doing and then prioritizing your orgasm, and your partner’s, or vice versa. “You come, then I come,” or even “You do me, then I’ll do you”—hey, it works, and everyone enjoys themselves.

If you do want to go for simultaneous orgasm, the three most important factors are clitoral stimulation, communication between partners, and the ability of the quickest-to-orgasm partner to ride the pleasurable waves of the plateau phase while their partner works up to climax. Often this is a timeframe during which you’ll want to talk about how close you are, ask your partner to wait or to do something different, and out-loud communicate. This helps navigate the particular fuck you’re having, but also to learn each others’ timing and responses. Something else to consider—get good and orgasmic one at a time before you take this step. If orgasm isn’t easy for each or even one partner to achieve, it will put lots more pressure on both people during the attempt for simultaneous climaxes.





Seeing Red: Sex During Menstruation


Some people are concerned about having intercourse while a woman is menstruating. There’s no medical reason to avoid intercourse during a period, other than general comfort, though some people find it messy and prefer to wait. Some women love intercourse while having their period, finding it reduces pelvic congestion that can come with their menses. They put a towel or disposable pad down, or use a diaphragm or cervical cup to catch the blood. Vigorous thrusting can dislodge these at high-flow times of her cycle—so a towel is a good idea as back-up. Because intercourse while menstruating brings you in contact with blood, you might want to increase safer sex precautions.





Vaginal Fisting


We’ve said many times that size doesn’t matter, except when it does—and some people find they really do love large insertion, whether it’s via a toy, more than a few fingers, or even an entire hand. The latter practice is called “fisting.” The term perhaps makes it sound rough and super-intense, but it is possible to engage in fisting in a very slow, almost meditative way. In fact, it’s probably best to do it that way, at least at first, so as not to do damage. Fisting is not for everyone—some vaginas don’t want to be entered by even a finger, much less five of them—but remember that when aroused, the vagina can be quite flexible, and any organ that can stretch enough to birth an infant can potentially accommodate at least a small fist. Susie Bright discovered when she was pregnant that the perineal massage her birth coach instructed her to do seemed a lot like the fisting she was familiar with from the frisky San Francisco sex underground, and she even wrote an essay about it in On Our Backs[ii]. So perhaps many women have practically been fisted in a birth preparation context and don’t even know it!

Although many vaginas lubricate a lot under optimal arousal conditions, it is possible to be very aroused and into penetration without having a lot of wetness to ease the way, so to anyone interested in exploring fisting (or large toy, or many-finger penetration) we say: Got lube? Other things to be aware of: The person whose hand will enter the receptive partner’s vagina may ease the way by wearing a glove, as long as the fist-ee is not sensitive to latex; some choose latex-free gloves to be on the safe side. They should also trim and file nails and remove any scratchy hangnails so that the entry is not marred by roughness. Fisting starts out like any finger penetration might: The receptive partner is in charge of how many fingers go in, how vigorous the play is, and when they want more lubrication. We said this could be a meditative act, and it certainly can—but it can also be active and sexual, and the recipient must be very aroused. This can be encouraged by G-spot play (if you like it), clitoral touch or vibration, and anything else that excites you and makes you want vaginal penetration.

From two or three fingers, the insertive partner goes to four, then five. It can be more comfortable to insert the width of the palm on a diagonal, not horizontally, since the bones of the pelvis are not flexible and may affect comfort, depending on the size of the insertive partner’s hand. Curl the two sides of the palm in toward each other as much as possible; some people have more flexible hands than others. The other element to be especially aware of is how prominent the knuckles are. Beware of any fisting position that leaves the knuckles pointing up towards the clitoris, since rubbing them on the upper wall as you enter the vagina can be painful—they are the most hard and inflexible part of the hand. Make sure there is extra lube at the point of contact of knuckles and vaginal opening, since this can be the “sticking point” in getting the entire hand to enter. The diagonal approach can help with this, too.

When the hand does go in, it will naturally curl into a fist. It will likely be extremely tight, especially at first, and at this point, and perhaps for the entire experience, it isn’t about “fist-fucking”—it’s about intense fullness. Remember when we explained that the neurology of the vagina responds most to pressure, motion, and fullness? Even if you get no in-and-out motion whatsoever, this fully engages the nerves that respond to these sensations. Clitoral touch can help manage and ease this intense experience, and some like to orgasm with a fist inside—though the contractions of orgasm will add to the sensations of squeeze. Some do like in-and-out motion with fisting. Beware, though, of moving the inserting hand from side to side—like you were turning a steering wheel back and forth on a twisty road. This can stretch ligaments that don’t spring back.

Are you wondering whether this stretches the vagina into a large, loose space? Please refer again to our discussion of the pelvic floor and Kegel muscles—just as Kegels will return a post-childbirth vagina to a state of tightness, they will do the same for someone who enjoys fisting. In fact, if these muscles are at their flexible best, fisting will be easier and maximally pleasurable. There are many other reasons to do your Kegels—but here’s one more.





Enjoying Anal Sex: Lubrication, Communication and Relaxation


Many people are interested in trying anal sex, or eroticize it; they might fantasize about it or enjoy anal scenes in erotica. It’s a common desire, even used by some as a method of birth control—yet to have a good time during anal play, we need information we never learned in school. Doing it wrong can hurt, maybe worse. Many people believe it’s supposed to hurt, or that the pain can’t be avoided—if you read some erotic novels, anal pain often supposedly “turns to pleasure.”

But the fact is, anal sex can be pleasurable from the get-go, not painful or scary. A little knowledge can make a huge difference in avoiding pain. With anal penetration, pain is a signal that you’re doing something wrong. Fantasize all you want about painful anal sex, if that’s a turn-on—but don’t make it your standard in real life.





The Missing Chapter: Pegging a.k.a. Male Anal Pleasure


If you are a woman looking for that special chapter on giving your man anal pleasure, you are in the right spot, and you’re not alone, because just about everybody has an anus, and our information about how to play with and pleasure butts is for all and sundry! This is for lesbians with strap-ons, individuals sticking something up their own bottoms, bisexuals doing anything they like, heterosexuals using their own nature-made body parts, gay men with any combinations of store-bought or factory original, heterosexual women with silicone dildos and their male partners, whether trans or cis. So why is there no pegging chapter? Because we don’t need one!





But if you’re looking for permission to play this way, all we can say is, “Join the club”—when the idea for the cult sex ed movie Bend Over Boyfriend was born at Good Vibrations, it was instigated because so many women and their gentlemen friends came to the store to buy a dildo and harness combo. Whether they wanted to reverse roles or just explore new erotic options, we reminded them to get lube, assured them that anal sex didn’t mean the guy was gay—generally, if he’d been gay, he’d have come shopping with his boyfriend—and let them know that they were hardly the only couple to want to give this kind of sex play a whirl.





Lubrication




We put lubrication first because it’s the easiest first step—once you have lubricant, you’ll be ready for communication and relaxation, the other two crucial keys to anal exploration and pleasure. The rectum doesn’t produce lubrication the way the vagina does, so everyone—everyone—we mean every person, each human, needs lube for anal penetration. If you are touching and doing external anal play, lubrication will still enhance your experience, and we think it’s good to always have it at the ready. We have a whole section on lubricants, but let’s answer your question here: “Which lube do I need for anal sex?”

If you want to use a water-based brand, thicker lubricants work better for anal play since they create a more cushioning surface to protect sensitive tissues. Water-based lubricants offer a slippery texture that many people like, but they tend to dry out after a while. No matter how much you use, sooner or later you’re going to need more. Water-based lubes can be made with glycerine and without. The ones with glycerine usually last longer, but get a bit sticky, whereas glycerine-free lubes may not get as sticky, but they also generally don’t last as long.

Silicone lubricants don’t dry out, which makes them great for anal play. Since they’re waterproof, they’re lots of fun in the tub as well. They can be a bit trickier to clean up because they don’t rinse away easily—watch out when you’re using them in a tiled bathroom, or pretty much anyplace else, because these lubes are super-slippery! Superior slickness is what makes silicone lubricant a favorite for fun in the tub, but it’s slippery on any surface, so make sure you watch where you step during afterglow, and clean up any spills. Silicone lubricants can damage some silicone toys, so protect them with a condom.

Speaking of condoms—use them! The rectum is a likely place for STI bacteria and viruses to get a toehold—well, they don’t have toes, but you know what we mean. Condoms also protect you from the E. coli bacteria that live naturally in the digestive tract but that wreak havoc when they enter the urethra or the vagina. Barrier methods of all kinds make anal play safer for everyone.





Communication


Being able to talk with your partner about anal play is essential—it allows you to make sure that you’re both enjoying it. Check in with each other about your physical comfort, which sensations feel good, or if you want to try something different. If you are trying anal sex with someone new or for the first time, it’s important to respect limits in order for your body to know it’s safe. Newcomers to anal play might have difficulty describing exactly what they want. Try offering different options and ask which feels better. Even people who have lots of anal play experience find that talking while playing makes it more pleasurable.

Communication is also key to avoiding pain and damage. With communication, you can ask for more lube; request that your partner go slower or stop moving for a bit; decide it’s time to change positions; as well as ask for more.





Relaxation


Trusting a partner to not hurt you, because you know you have good communication skills and they respect your limits, helps relaxation—as does knowing what you are doing in the first place. And relaxing leads to more pleasure and less pain.

One of the biggest mistakes associated with anal sex is thinking that an anus is like a vagina. It’s not, and not only because we might think of it as a tighter orifice. As said above, extra lubrication is necessary, but that’s not all—the muscles of the anus work differently, plus our society has a big taboo around anal sex, which complicates things even more. In order to achieve anal sex’s next requirement, relaxation, let’s take a minute to understand the way these muscles work.

The anus includes two separate sphincters, muscles that are about a quarter of an inch apart. Think of the anus as a tube, usually about three to five centimeters long. The external muscle is the bigger tube on the outside of the canal and is under your control; most people can tense and relax it fairly easily. The internal muscle is the smaller tube inside the voluntary muscle lining, with folds like a drawstring purse—or a laundry bag when the bag is pulled together tight, if you’re not the purse-carrying type. This inner muscle is involuntary; it’s controlled by the same part of your nervous system as breathing and heart rate. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed this second muscle will be.

Here’s a parallel example: If you have a racing heart, you can’t just tell your heart to slow down. That doesn’t work. Matter of fact, someone yelling at you to “Calm down!” would probably make you more tense, increasing your heart rate more. But you can learn to deep-breathe and do relaxation techniques, which in turn relax you, and then your heart rate can slow. Your anal sphincter works the same way. You can’t pressure yourself into relaxing, nor will a partner saying, “Just relax!” cause you to do so—that does not work and never will. But learning relaxation techniques; feeling safe, respected and cared for; and lastly, feeling confident and knowledgeable about how to have pleasurable anal sex does help the anus relax.





Safe Anal Pleasure For All


Getting turned on is a great way to help the anus relax. Before we start, grab a big bottle of lube; clean up your hands, fingernails, body parts, and toys; and have your favorite way to climax at the ready. If this is jacking off with your hand then you’re set; if your choice is a Magic Wand vibrator, then plug it in nearby.



First, if you are with a partner, read this section aloud together and be sure that you both agree and understand it. Set a limit that you are not going to have anal penetration during these sexercises. Loud and clear say and agree, “No matter what my body is saying—even if I am writhing around moaning—still do not stick anything in!” That will help you relax and let loose, able to enjoy feeling arousing sensation against the anus. If you are secretly thinking, “If I really push and grind against fingers/dildo/penis my partner will stick in it me”—and we don’t want that yet—then you won’t feel totally free to let loose into those motions and moans.

OK, now are you ready for freedom and relaxation? Do whatever you love to do sexually that arouses you. Then try massaging gently around the anus, paying attention to how much pressure and what kind of touch feels best. More tickly? More firm? Circles? Across? What feels good? If you are partnered, share your thoughts as this exploration is happening. If you are doing this solo then just lie back and enjoy, or notice what you don’t enjoy.

Many people enjoy vibration, so if you have a vibrator, try playing with that externally around the anus. (To use a vibrator for anal insertion, it must be smooth and have a base, or else you run the risk of abrasion or losing it inside.) Try rimming, or licking around the anus, if you want, which you might find relaxing as well as erotic. If you want to make this practice safer, do it through a dam or plastic wrap. If you stimulate your clitoris or penis you might find that your anus tightens up, so for the purposes of this exercise, let’s leave those areas alone for now.

You’ve writhed and moaned and done it all. We suggest, if you are partnered, you postpone insertion until you’ve done this exercise a few or many times over days or weeks. That really relaxes one’s bottom! When you are ready to insert a finger or toy, let the receiver control the depth and speed of penetration.





Insertion


Make sure the receiver’s anus is well-lubed, and that the toy, finger, penis or other inserting body part or item is, too. Rather than lining up the insertive part with the anus and moving in, as you would tend to do during vaginal penetration, it’s best if the receiving partner bears down. Yes, rather than going into the anus, the anus goes onto the finger. Poking at the anus tends to trigger a reflex that tightens it greatly, making penetration hurt—so don’t push or poke, but let the anus open up and begin to engulf the finger. Only then do you begin to slide in further, with the insertee setting the pace for speed, depth, requests for additional lube, and all the other elements that might go into insertive play.

If you are masturbating, let your ass tell your hand when it feels good instead of just jamming the toy in. Sounds funny to say, but your anus will open and pucker and “kiss” the toy when ready. Lots of lube, remember? Start off with something slim and smooth (with a base!) and don’t force or rush it. Tease with the toy in reapplying lots of lube, which will push lube ahead of the toy and help a bit. Don’t use a toy with ridges or other texturing at first. Develop your confidence with smaller toys, then move up gently, if you want a larger item at all. Frequently add extra lube. First-time anal players often need to get used to these feelings, so the slower you go, the better.

If and when you decide to use a ridged toy—though most people find anal sex intense without the added stimulation of ridges—buy one that’s small in diameter, measured at its largest point, so you can get used to sliding the ridged part past your internal sphincter. A lot of gentle bearing down always helps. Butt plugs—those fir tree-shaped anal toys that are designed to be inserted and stay in place—are a special case. When inserting, lube it well, then put the wide part up against your anus, tilt the toy and use a circular movement of the base (treat it like an old fashioned ice cream crank) to tilt and rotate it in. It will come out easier the same way, with a rotating motion. There is a geometric reason for this involving rotational dimensions, but we won’t go there now…

And don’t let the lube roll out of reach. You may want to reapply it many times during anal exploration.

Last but not least, many people will want a vibrator handy for clitoral stimulation, or be ready for penis stimulation while exploring anal fullness or in-and-out motion. This can ensure that arousal remains high and the experience of anal exploration feels sexy from beginning to end.

ALERT: Some people have heard or read that numbing creams are the answer to easy anal sex. They are not. Numbing creams might make the nerves in the anus less sensitive, but they won’t help the muscles relax. They may make it more difficult to notice uncomfortable sensations, which can result in irritation, damage to the tissues, including the pain of irritating hemorrhoids and even fissures, and bleeding. It’s a lot safer to learn to relax and communicate instead. Fissures are one of the most painful conditions a person can have, and once you have hemorrhoids they can painfully recur throughout life, so we are not talking about five minutes of pain in the moment. Besides, the numbing cream will also get on the insertive partner, which may not be what they had in mind.

Anal Fisting: Anal sex can be intense even with a small toy or one finger, because the anus is so very nerve-rich. Most people, even those who are into anal play, will never try anal fisting, but this is a type of erotic play that some people love. Advanced anal penetration like this can’t really be learned from a book, and this is not the place to explain how it’s done—but in some places you can find classes about it, and like some forms of BDSM, this is a sexual practice that is best taught from one experienced person to another who would like to learn the skill. Contrary to popular myth, anal fisting is not about pain, and it is more often a very slow and meditative practice than a rowdy one.





An Anal Rinse


Some people prefer to clean out with an anal rinse, sometimes called an enema, before engaging in prostate or anal play. While this may or may not be necessary, some people feel more comfortable doing so. if you decide on one, we suggest using a re-usable enema bulb.

Here are a few simple steps:

Wash the bulb out well before use. Fill it most of the way with warm water. While you can use tap water, we suggest using filtered water, since tap water has chlorine and other chemicals that may irritate you. It may enter your bloodstream, too, because of the way the rectal mucosa allows material to filter through. It’s also best to use wrist-temperature water. If it’s too cold it can cause cramps, and if it’s too hot it can be painful. If using a bag, fill it about halfway.

Attach the nozzle of your choice. Those with larger openings will release the water more quickly. Some enema bulbs and bags come with nozzles in several sizes, so you can choose.

Lubricate the nozzle with any lubricant you like. Generally, thicker lubes work better. You may also want to add lubricant around the anus. For some, lubricants containing glycerine might cause irritation and should be avoided; one element of this irritation, when the lube is used rectally, is to provoke bowel movement. So you may find you keep the rectum clean longer by avoiding glycerine-based brands. As discussed above, in our section on lubricants, some people have no problem with this ingredient, while others do.

Many people prefer to lie on their back or on their left side when using an enema, but this is optional for an anal rinse, which doesn’t try to get water all the way up into the colon; others use the bulb or enema bag while they’re sitting on the toilet. You may need to experiment a bit to find the position that works best for you. If you lie down, place a towel on the floor, both to catch any water and to make yourself more comfortable. It is also possible to insert the nozzle while standing; sometimes people choose this method because it’s quicker and they don’t intend to have a complete enema, but rather just want to rinse out the rectum.

Gently insert the nozzle. If you’re new to anal play, reading our tips on insertion will make it easier. Most importantly, go slowly, and don’t try to push in past any tension; just let your body relax.

Squeeze the bulb to release the water into the rectum. Be careful to not let go of the bulb since it can suck the water back into it. If you’re using a bag instead, there will be a valve release on the hose.

If there’s some water left in the bulb, don’t worry about it. Gently remove the nozzle and set the bulb aside.

You can hold the water in for a few minutes, if it’s comfortable. When you’re ready, release the water into the toilet. Repeat a few times, if you feel the need.

When you’re done, be sure to wash the bulb and nozzle thoroughly and let them fully dry before putting them away.

Since the rectum can trap some water, you may want to be near a bathroom for an hour or two. Walking around, moving and stretching can help move any remaining water so it can exit the body.



Most people who use an enema frequently use salinated water because non-salinated water in the rectum can leach minerals out of the body; keeping the water you use at about the same saline level as the body itself helps prevent this. You don’t have to buy saline; just add one-half teaspoon of non-iodized salt to one cup of water. This doesn’t have to be exact, and a little less salt is better than a little too much. But for most purposes, warm filtered water is just fine.





Choosing an Anal Toy




Anal toys are a great way to explore different sensations. Toys designed for anal play are smooth, easy to clean and have a base—something flared at the end so they won’t go all the way inside. Start off with a slim toy for easier insertion. Some people eventually like to experiment with wider toys, while others use slender toys for years without any desire for something larger. The anus is extremely sensitive, so toys with ridges or edges might be too rough. But that said, whatever you like is what’s important.

Dildos are relatively straight, or sometimes slightly curved, with a flare or balls at the base. They can go in and out, which many people like. They come in a range of sizes and shapes. Glass toys are great if you like a firm sensation, but first-timers may prefer silicone since it’s more flexible. Dildos can be used by hand or, if they’re flexible, with a harness.

Butt plugs have a wider bulb and narrower neck. Once inserted, they stay in place as the anal muscles grip the neck, creating a sensation of fullness without the back-and-forth motion—no harness here. They’re hands-free and can be combined with any other sex play you like. During orgasm, anal muscles contract along with the muscles of the vagina or penis, so plugs can intensify pleasure. Since the wall between the vagina and rectum is relatively thin, many women and some trans men and their partners like to use plugs during intercourse—in some positions, a penis can feel extra sensation from the plug; many people enjoy simultaneous vaginal and rectal fullness.





Safety Tips


Anal toys must have a base to keep them from going all the way into the anus. If your toy doesn’t have a base, don’t insert it anally. Not even a little bit. It’s easier to lose a toy than you think, especially since, during orgasm, some people’s anal muscles create a certain amount of suction that can draw a toy further inside. Plus, lubricant on your hands makes a toy harder to hold. This can mean a trip to the emergency room, so avoid the risk and use an anal-safe toy.

Cleanliness is more of a concern for anal play than for most other types of sex. Make sure that any toys used for anal sex, especially insertion, can be cleaned or are covered with a condom. Silicone, glass and metal toys can be disinfected, but porous materials like jelly and elastomer can’t get 100% clean. Never use anything anally and then vaginally without cleaning it first!

If you’re concerned about personal cleanliness, please read our information about how to use an enema.

Anything that goes into the anus needs to be unbreakable, and most people prefer their toys smooth. Over time glass toys can lose their tempering and break (though we’d like to meet the superhero vagina or anus that can break tempered glass!), wood can splinter… ridges on toys designed to add stimulation when used in the vagina can cause irritation or pain when used anally—and not all vaginas like that extra sensation either. Even calluses and edges on fingernails can be too rough, but gloves will keep your hands clean and smooth.

What About the Prostate? Is it the Male G-Spot?


The prostate gland is a sexual organ that surrounds the urethra, the tube that urine passes through, just below the bladder. The prostate produces almost half of the fluid that makes up semen and it’s about the size of a golf ball, although not as hard. During arousal, the prostate enlarges and swells with fluid, which it expels during ejaculation.

As men age, the prostate can enlarge, which often makes urination difficult, since the urethra passes through the center of the prostate. Prostate massage can ease the discomfort; there’s some evidence that this can reduce the risk of getting an enlarged prostate in the first place. If you’re having difficulty urinating, get checked out by a doctor. All men over fifty should be checked for prostate cancer annually. Men of African descent have a higher rate of prostate cancer and should start getting checked annually at forty-five.





Why Try Prostate Stimulation?


The prostate is amazingly sensitive, and many men enjoy prostate sensations. The gland is similar to the G-spot in women, both in terms of what sorts of stimulation most people like and how it feels. Many men report that prostate stimulation feels less focused than penis stimulation, and that orgasms during prostate play feel bigger, more expansive, and more intense.

One reason men may enjoy anal penetration is that it stimulates the prostate. Some of those men then wonder about their sexual orientation. It’s useful to remember that what feels good physically depends on the location and stimulation of your nerve endings, and these don’t have anything to do with whether a person is gay, straight, bisexual or other. Sexual orientation has almost nothing to do with specific sex acts, but everything to do with the gender of the person/s with whom you want to do them. Despite common mythologies, these two things aren’t remotely the same.





Finding the Prostate


People who are really flexible might be successful stimulating the prostate with their own fingers, but many find that exploring the prostate is easier with a little help from a partner or a toy. No matter what you are doing, you need to lube up fingers or toys first. To the inserter: Insert a lubed finger (trim those fingernails!) or toy a few inches into the anus and curve towards the navel—upwards if they’re face up. Search for a spot that feels different from the surrounding area. You’ll probably be able to feel the prostate with your finger, especially if your partner is turned on and the prostate is engorged. If you’re using a toy to find their prostate you’ll need to get feedback from them, since it can be a bit trickier to tell when you’re on the spot.

Prostate stimulation can sometimes cause a feeling like the need to urinate, just as many women find G-spot stimulation can. Try a slightly gentler stimulation and let your body get used to it. With practice and familiarity, you can learn to tell the feelings apart. You may notice some clear fluid coming from your urethra. That’s prostatic fluid being massaged out of the gland.

Make sure that anything you insert into the anus is smooth, unbreakable, easy to clean, has a base, and is well-lubricated.

You may find that prostate play feels better while doing something else you enjoy, such as penis massage, masturbation or oral sex. Combining something familiar with something new may help you learn to appreciate something you haven’t tried before.

If you’re going to engage in prostate play, be sure to read this book’s entire section on anal pleasure, from toys to technique.

Now that you’ve found your prostate, let’s explore it. Try the “come hither” motion with your finger, moving your finger in circles, or gently tapping the prostate. Some people think that a “windshield wiper” motion feels great. Many say they enjoy stroking, rubbing, tapping, circles, firm pressure, and/or vibration on the prostate.

Generally, actions such as pushing, tapping, stroking, pressure, or larger motions feel better than small motions and vibrations—though some do enjoy prostate vibration.

To make cleanup easy, use a non-porous toy or cover it with a condom. Using gloves is another great way to keep things clean.

Some men and trans women love prostate play, while others say it doesn’t do anything for them or even that it doesn’t feel good.

Different sensations can feel good at different times during the arousal cycle.





Using Toys for the Prostate


Many find that they enjoy stronger prostate stimulation as they become more aroused. If your fingers get tired, or if you want to try a different sensation, try an anal-safe toy.

Most prostate toys have a gentle curve, just as many G-spot vibrators do. In fact, any anal-safe G-spot toy may be worth trying on the prostate. You can use the curved tip to create a sliding sensation as it moves in and out. Or angle it into the prostate for intense pressure. You can even rotate it from side to side, which is a type of stimulation that fingers can’t do as easily.

You might like the way a vibrator feels on the prostate. Look for one with a strong vibration at or near the tip, since that’s the spot that will come into contact with your prostate. Or try one with a vibrator near the base to stimulate the anus while you angle the tip against the prostate.

Butt plugs can be great for prostate stimulation, especially during oral sex or intercourse. Plugs stay in place and leave your hands free for other business. Since the plugs don’t move, you may get more prostate sensations if you move your hips or squeeze and release the PC muscle to bring your prostate into contact with the toy.





If You Have Medical Issues


If you have medical issues related to your prostate, please ask your doctor about prostate massage or stimulation. It might be just what the doctor orders, or it might not, so be safe and check with your medical provider first. We acknowledge that it might be difficult for some men to ask a doctor. Please remember, you never need to feel shame about a consensual sex act between adults. We offer this simple sentence as a way to ask, “Doctor, will prostate massage help my condition, or might it be harmful?” And then let the doctor do the talking. She could tell you yes or say “No, that’s dangerous in your condition.”





Your Sex Clean-Up Questions Answered


Is it true that I should pee after sex?


Peeing after sex is always a good idea—it’s a great way to avoid urinary tract infections, as any bacteria that may have worked their way up the urethra can get washed out again by the stream of urine.





Any special cock-washing instructions?


Penises can basically be washed off just like you’d wash your hands. This not only rinses your partner’s secretions away, if any, but also any trace of the lube you used. It may be tempting to wash up with anti-bacterial soap, but don’t. The commonly-available ones contain triclosan. This ingredient is one that many people are sensitive to, however, and we do not recommend it for delicate mucosa. For uncircumcised men, washing under the foreskin is important: pull it back and clean out any material that may have worked its way underneath. Some clit hoods are mobile enough and sizeable enough that it’s wise to do the same.





How do I wash off cum and shit when I’m in the bathroom of a date’s apartment?


Use soap and water, or cleansing wipes that are individually wrapped—great for the overnight date—and are formulated to be safe for genitals. If there’s fecal material, especially, it’s great if you can shower after sex—or rinse before anal play so there’s less chance of shit as part of the experience. Again, no anti-bacterial soap.





Is there added danger or irritation with scrubbing herpes?


If you have a herpes outbreak you should carefully and gently cleanse with soap and water but not scrub or irritate. This goes for any genital condition where the skin is compromised and sensitive.





Are rough hands a problem?


Any danger from rough hands during vigorous clean-up would be basically the same as you’d get from them if they were handling your parts during sex—in particular, rough nails and hangnails would be a problem. That’s why wearing latex gloves during sex is great because you can just pull them off, discard and be done.





Should I brush my teeth for oral sex?


Before oral, no. The toothbrush makes micro-abrasions and makes oral STI (including HIV) transmission, ordinarily pretty low risk, into a higher-risk activity. Also, for the same reason, no flossing prior to oral sex. Since brushing immediately after sex might carry some risk, mouthwash is recommended instead.





Douching isn’t necessary to smell good before sex, but is it safe for after?


Douching is not ever necessary, nor is it a good idea; commercial douches expose your mucosa to chemicals, while even douching with plain water can move bacteria further into the vaginal cavity and potentially into the uterus. If you’ve heard douching recommended as a birth control method, this is a myth.





Sexual Positions


It can be lovely having sex in one position time after time—if it’s not broke, why fix it? On the other hand, many lovers want to mix it up. They’re looking for extra stimulation, sophistication, excitement—a Kama Sutra worth of sexual pleasure. Why not? Do what you like, but exploring variations is worthwhile if you both want to try some new moves. That said, if you love and want to stick to your “same-old,” please don’t feel bad about it—we should all be so lucky to find the sexual activities we love! Make sure your partner loves it too, and you’re good to go: Keep making each other happy! If you’d both like to change it up, though, we’ve got your back.

Here are some useful considerations when we talk about positions:

We’re going to assume when we talk about intercourse positions that there is a penetrating partner, whether that person has a penis or a strap-on dildo. Some partners have both. There are some whose penises don’t get hard when they want to have intercourse who use a dildo in a harness instead. It’s the right tool for the job.

And of course there will then be an “insertee”—let’s just cut to the chase and say “the one who’s being fucked.” If you like the sporty language of “pitching and catching” better than these Anglo-Saxonisms, feel free to substitute.

In some cases, the catcher will be catching anally—in others, vaginally. If it’s a wild party, both.

Remember that many people believe that vaginal intercourse is the primary way that everybody has an orgasm. Research indicates that this is far from true—so enjoy intercourse if you find it pleasurable, and do everything else that might result in orgasm too.

Remember too that a major reason intercourse doesn’t always result in anything close to orgasm is that it often starts way too early for the insertee’s pleasure. So don’t go there too soon; when vaginal intercourse starts before arousal has built, it can be underwhelming—or worse. Try this: The catcher’s in charge. Let your partner tell you when it’s time to go in.

Same goes for anal—the insertee is in charge of when, how fast, how long, and when to add lube.

Not all positions are created equal for all partners. Each person may have preferences based on the way their own body responds best, meaning that for some, being on top is an easier orgasm, while for others it’s more likely to happen on the bottom—or some other variation of bodies in connection. There’s no one best way, unless there’s clearly one best way for you.

The position/s you find most comfortable—suitable for your body shape, for the way your bodies fit, your relative heights, and other variables—might not always be the best position for orgasm, but rather allow you to be “in” your body in a way that allows you to focus on sensations and feel comfortable and sexy.

Some positions are best for intimate, eye-gazing, deep-kissing bonding. In others, you can’t see the whites of each other’s eyes! But each can hold its charms.

Some positions might be especially well-suited to G-spot or prostate pleasure, since the G-spot and prostate are not always optimally reached during intercourse, but some positions are better at stimulating them than others.

Some positions might be best for longer penises or dildos, or conversely for shorter ones.



We’re not going to give positions fancy or cute names here, unless the name already has wide currency. Some of the positions we discuss have other names in books or videos about positions. We’re pretty sure it doesn’t matter what you call them, as long as you enjoy doing them.





Intercourse Positions: Penetrating partner on top


The two main variables in this group of positions involve how the receiving partner holds their legs, and how the penetrating partner’s body is positioned: lying on their partner, or up so that the main area of contact is the genitals. These can be intimate and pleasurable positions, with opportunities for eye contact, kissing, embracing, and roaming hands, at least on the part of the receiving partner; the inserting partner may be using their arms to hold themselves up.

Please note: Body weight can be an issue if the top partner doesn’t lift at least some of their mass off the bottom partner. If the weight doesn’t bother the partner on the bottom, the skin-to-skin contact can be excellent erotic stimulation. If it does, try the “propped-up” versions of these, or move to other positions where weight disparity or the bottom partner’s sensitivity isn’t an issue.

These positions can generally all be made to work for anal intercourse, but those which involve putting weight on the bottom partner may interfere with their ability to relax enough for comfortable anal insertion.

The classic “inserter on top” position, missionary, was called “the squashed bug position” by a lesbian writer who obviously had had enough of someone’s body weight in a past life! The receiving partner lies on their back, generally with legs somewhat spread, and the penetrating partner inserts into them with a substantial amount of body contact.



The Coital Alignment Technique is a variant of missionary in which the receiving partner, instead of spreading legs wide, wraps them around their partner’s legs to draw the two of them, particularly their genitals, closer together. The intent is to bring the clitoris in closer contact with the partner’s pubis, making orgasm more likely.





Other variations:


The penetrating partner can lean up on elbows or hands, separating their torsos while staying genitally connected.





The receiving partner can spread their legs wider; this may allow for somewhat deeper penetration.





The receiving partner can drape their legs over the penetrating partner’s arms, or shoulders if that’s comfortable given their degree of physical flexibility.





The receiving partner can bring their legs up to their chest; this may allow for somewhat deeper penetration.





The receiving partner can wrap their legs around the penetrating partner’s neck, which often allows for significantly deeper penetration.

Instead of bending over, the penetrating partner kneels, while the receiving partner, with knees pulled up to their chest, positions body up on their partner’s thighs for close genital contact.

If the two partners’ bits don’t fit ideally well together—in particular if the vagina is roomy compared to the size of the penis—either partner can put pressure along the sides of the vulva, “squishing” it down to give more tightness and sensation upon entry.





Intercourse Positions: Receiving partner on top


This allows the receiving partner far more motion and ability to control depth and speed of thrusting. It’s usually still done face to face, and both partner’s hands can be freed up to touch one another. Often the person on top will brace themselves on their partner’s chest, leaning forward, or lean back and hold the partner’s thighs.

The classic position in this category is usually called “woman astride” and may also be called the “cowgirl”—though if the receiving partner is not female-identified, they’ll probably want to come up with a name that suits them better. This position is associated with female orgasm, since the partner on top can move her body as much as she needs to optimize arousal and clitoral contact, among other orgasmic variables. This is also a comfortable position for those who are pregnant—unless their knees protest at supporting their weight. The partner on top generally kneels over the penetrating partner, though body size and flexibility may be an issue. The top partner’s knees or the size of the partner on the bottom can be a comfort issue.



Variations:

The penetrating partner raises their legs so the partner on top can lean back against their knees.

The receiving partner squats over the penetrating partner; if they have strong thighs, this can power stronger thrusts than the kneeling version of this position.

For larger-bodied folks—either partner—this position usually allows for good genital access, as well as letting the person on top control the amount of pressure on their partner’s body. If two bellies need more room, the top partner can turn around to face away (hence the name “Reverse Cowgirl”––but let us tell you, plenty o’ cowboys love this position too).





If the bed has a headboard, the partner on top can hold it and use it to help stabilize and power their thrusts.

This position can also be done sitting up, seated in a chair with no arms. The receiving partner sits on the penetrating partner’s lap. This may be a great option for those whose knees hurt when they kneel or squat. Make sure the chair is strong enough to stand up to your combined weight and movement.





Intercourse Positions: Other face to face


Rather than lying down face to face, the partners can stand, particularly if one is leaning back against something they can brace against (like a wall or a very sturdy piece of furniture) and if their heights are comparable. Sometimes the receiving partner lifts one leg, which can be supported by the penetrating partner.

A variation on the standing position involves lifting the receiving partner up so the penetrating partner can enter them; their legs are wrapped around the inserting partner’s waist, and sometimes the receiving partner’s back is braced against a wall for stability. In a further variation, sometimes the receiving partner, legs still around the other’s waist, falls backward, head toward ground. Is this common? We don’t think it’s most people’s go-to position, let’s put it that way. But some people want to check off every single page in the Kama Sutra.

The classic Tantra position, Yab Yum, is slow, intimate, and definitely worth exploring regardless of your feelings about ancient spiritual techniques. The receiving partner sits on the penetrating partner’s lap, face to face, and wraps their legs around the other’s waist. They can embrace, kiss, eye-gaze, and—if they wish—do other tantric exercises as they’re coupled. In a variation, each partner can lean back on their arms; this allows for a little more powerful thrusting.





Scissoring involves each partner lying on their side, face to the other partner’s feet, and bringing their genitals together. Perfect for foot fetishists—and adding foot massage or toe-sucking into intercourse. This tends to be a fairly slow and languid position.





Intercourse Positions: Rear entry


Doggie style is the classic rear entry position. It can be done when both partners are lying down, the receiving partner on their stomach and the penetrating partner over them. As with missionary, it can vary according to how much weight and full contact the penetrating partner brings. It can also be done with the receptive partner on all fours; in this case, they are not bearing their partner’s full weight. The receiving partner can control comfort, having to do with where the dildo or penis hits inside, as well as friction on the outside, by choosing how far they are bent over: anywhere from standing and bent fully over touching toes, or holding behind knees, to standing up and barely being bent over at all; often it’s somewhere in the middle, bent over a pillow or on all fours.



Most rear entry positions are great for anal intercourse.

Variations:

Doggie style is often done standing, with one partner leaning forward. The penetrating partner can also hold the receiving partner around the waist. Positioning straps can help with balance and comfort, just as position furniture does. Good Vibrations carries two sizes to accommodate a range of body size; it’s great for positioning assistance.

It is also common to do rear entry positions over an edge, like a table or the edge of the bed. If the bed is low, it can be done from a kneeling position. Make sure the furniture you choose can’t be easily pushed or collapsed!

Reverse cowgirl is also a variation on doggie style; the penetrating partner lies on their back and the receiving partner kneels over them, facing towards the other’s feet.





Intercourse Positions: Other rear entry


	 Spooning is a languid position that basically looks like doggie style turned on its side—the penetrating partner is behind the receiving partner. It can also be called “77.”





	 In the T position the receiving partner lies on their back, with the penetrating partner coming in from the side. With a slight alteration in angle, this can work well for either vaginal or anal intercourse, and because the penis or dildo enters more or less sideways, it can feel quite a bit different than the more “straight-on” positions, especially if it’s curved.





	 T in an Armchair: This is another sideways position, this time with the receiving partner on top and supported not only by their partner’s arms, but also by the arms of a chair. This is not the same as Yab Yum, but is an alternative for those whose knees won’t allow them to bend down or be on the floor. It can be as active as you desire or it can be a more cozy, cuddly pose with lots of skin contact.





Positions: Oral


Fellatio can be done from a kneeling position; standing and bent forward; from a 69 position (see below); kneeling sideways on the bed next to the person being fellated; lying on back or side while the receiver kneels over the giver. It can make a difference to the comfort of the fellator that they can move their head freely. Fellatio variants include adding ball-fondling and anal play to the oral main event.



Cunnilingus is probably most frequently performed with the giver lying between the legs of the receiver or by the receiver straddling over their giver’s face.



Cunnilingus can also be done from the 69 position, as can other oral stimulation—whether you aim for someone’s vulva, anus, or penis, your partner can aim for yours at the same time. To do it, one partner lies down, and the other lies atop them so that each person’s face is close enough to the genitals of the other to reach them with their mouth. It can be done by people of any gender identity and genital configuration. If one of the partners has a penis, it’s a good idea to position that person on the bottom, so the fellator has more range of motion. 69 may not be the optimum position for everyone, because simultaneous oral sex can be a distracting experience. But some people find it highly erotic. Variants include vaginal insertion with fingers or toys, anal play, and doing it on your sides, not one on top of the other.



Anilingus may be most easily done with the receiving partner on hands and knees, back arched, which the giver comes in behind them. A variant on this has the receiving partner lying on their stomach, not up on all fours. It can also be done with the receiver kneeling over the giver’s torso, positioning their anus close to the giver’s face.





Sex Toys: The Right Tool For the Job


What is a sex toy? One way of answering this question would be “anything (besides another person) that stimulates the genitals.” If you walk around Good Vibrations or any other sex store, you’ll see items that clearly fill that bill, like vibrators, penis sleeves, dildos, cock rings, anal toys, and pleasure balls. But you’ll see sensuality-focused products too, and sexy games, erotic garments, porn, BDSM gear, lubricants, and lots of other things. Are those sex toys?

Absolutely yes! We define a sex toy as something that enhances sex: basically, anything you can play with—on any part of the body—for sexual purposes. That might expand the way you think of defining, and also using, sex toys: Not everyone plays with a thing; some people utilize add-ons that shape or enhance the experience—erotic costumes, for instance—but that do not fit the genitally-centered definition of a sexual toy or product. You decide which definition you like—just remember that sexual enhancement is worthwhile, whatever you use to do it!





Vibrators—An Orgasmic Revolution!


Vibrators: We love ’em! We know from experience that a vibrator is the gateway to becoming orgasmic for many people, but particularly for women who found it difficult or impossible to climax before they used one. In fact, that’s why Good Vibrations was founded in the first place: Joani Blank was working with pre-orgasmic women’s groups, and created the store as a safe and comfortable place for those women to shop.

Vibrators do two things very well: They provide consistent stimulation, whether it’s strong or mild or both, and they target nerve endings, which are plentiful on the clitoris and the penile corona and respond primarily to vibration. That’s right—specific nerves exist whose job it is to carry vibration upstairs to the brain! Ah, the wonders of nature! Whatever we used those nerves for before the advent of vibrators, we’re certainly glad they exist now, considering we have access to dozens, even hundreds of buzzy playthings specifically designed to give us pleasure.

The question then becomes: Which one/s might be right for you?





Inside or Outside?


When choosing a vibrator we first need to think about our bodies and the sensations each of us likes best—we’re not all the same in our preferences. Since a lot of vibrators are long and slender, you can use them for penetration. However, most of the most sensitive spots to vibrate are on or near the surface of the body, especially the clitoris, penile corona (the edges of the head of the penis), the vulva, the first couple of inches into the vagina, the perineum, around the anus, and just inside the anus as well. Deeper vaginal vibration in particular might not appeal so much, since beyond the first inch or two inside the vagina/anus, there are few internal nerve endings that respond to vibration.

Some vibrators are designed for external use only. Many have a motor at the tip, are egg- or bullet-shaped, oval and designed to fit in your palm, or fit on the finger like a ring, which makes them easy to hold against the clitoris, the penis, or wherever else you like the feeling they provide. However, these styles may not work as well (or at all) inside the body. There are many nerve endings inside that respond to pressure, motion, and fullness, which you can stimulate using a dildo or a dildo-like vibrator. But some people get a vibrator and slide it deep inside them, then say “Hey, that didn’t work at all. What’s the fuss about?” They’ve been led to believe that insertion is the primary source of sexual response, and don’t realize that there are a lot more exciting, and body-appropriate, ways to try their vibe! Plenty of people use vibrators and never include penetration in their repertoire.

The vibrating toys that work especially well for vaginal penetration have a motor in the base; this puts the strongest vibration closer to the vaginal introitus (entrance) and clitoris, where vibration-loving nerve endings are found. Many also love curved G-spot vibrators for vaginal insertion, though it may be the G-curvature more than the vibration that gets them going. And remember, if a toy doesn’t have a flared base or a T-bar shape, it is not for anal insertion. There are so many great anal toys out there, be sure you get the right tool for the job! The muscles in the anus work to pull the toy inward, and without a base it could continue to slip in further, making it difficult or impossible to remove without assistance. That could mean an exciting trip to the emergency room for you—even more excitement than you had in mind when you began your back-door adventure!





Can I Get Addicted to a Vibrator?


No.

The grain of truth in this myth: If you never have orgasms any other way, a vibe will become your go-to orgasm friend. And you may want to go to it often! That does not, however, mean you are addicted to it, nor that it has permanently supplanted your ability to have orgasms some other way. If you are concerned about this, switch it up and add plenty of hand play or partner sex to your erotic experiences. Give your body a chance to respond to many things, and instead of always using a vibrator solo, mix vibrator play with partner stimulation.





Soft or Strong Vibration?


When shopping for a vibrator, it’s often helpful if you know how sensitive you are, and know the same about your partner. If you’ve used a vibrator before, what worked in the past? If you’re looking for your first one, do you know if you like strong or mild sensations? Or perhaps you like different things at different times. While a vibe creates a sensation that’s undeniably different from anything else, if you know that you or your partner prefer a soft touch or a firm one, that will help you narrow the choices.





Vibrator Control of Movement


Do you like a variety of sensations? Do you want to start slowly, then increase the intensity? No matter what your style is—there’s a vibrator for it! You might want a vibrator that can change its rhythm—thump, thump buzzzz, thump, thump buzzzz. Or a slow tiny buzz that escalates to a big BUZZ. Some don’t even buzz at all. Different models have different options, from soft pulsations to deep and fast vibrations, escalating vibrations, gyrating, oscillating, throbbing, thrusting and more. Pulsators do actually thrust. Most vibes’ intensity level and motions are directed with controls on the vibrator itself, with a hand control attached by a wire, or on the remote control that comes with wireless models; in some cases these actually operate via your smartphone or wireless device.

As a general rule, the more options, the better, since you’ll have more choices to play with all in one toy. But some people prefer to collect a number of toys that each do different things.

If you visit one of our stores, you can test the strength of a vibrator before you purchase it; we keep a display model out for this purpose. You can also find out how loud it is. If you’re browsing our website you’ll notice that each model has its volume and intensity listed. Some vibrators may make more noise as they age and the bearings wear out, and harder materials such as plastic make more noise than softer ones like silicone, elastomers, or rubbers. Coil-style vibrators, which you can get at many drugstores or home-care departments, are extremely quiet.

Can you lose sensitivity using a vibrator? Yes, though it is a temporary state. It happens especially if you push down hard with the vibrator, as this slows blood flow in the area being stimulated. It’s similar to finding your hand has gotten numb if you’re leaning on it. There is another way this happens also. When you stimulate one area of the body a lot in the same exact way—one small area, repetitive motion—for a short while the brain tends to adapt to the input. Most people find that if they move the vibrator around a teeny bit, that movement is enough for the nerve receptors to re-set.





Different Vibrator Shapes & Styles


The small oblong “bullet”-type vibrator can be used alone or inserted into certain dildos or butt plugs for a nice sensation. One of the most basic of vibrator styles, it’s handy to have around because it’s so versatile. Bullets are good for teasing, arousing, and pleasing the clitoris or penis; they’re easy to hold between partners during intercourse. We don’t recommend using them internally; if you do, put it in a condom so you can retrieve it more easily. These playthings can be waterproof or not, attached to a battery pack by a cord, remote-controlled and wireless, or contain tiny batteries so you can turn the toy on and off with a touch.



The Rocket style is a single- or multi-speed vibrator that is small and battery-operated, making it discreet and easy to use. For external use only, it functions similarly to the bullet style, but many find it easier to hold, and its tip is circular and flat or styled with bumps that add sensation. A newer variant is waterproof, so it can go into the shower with you. Many vibrators these days are waterproof, so if this feature appeals to you, make sure you ask about it when vibrator-shopping, since some are for use on dry land only.



Shaft-style vibrators are those that might be inserted vaginally, anally, or both, or not inserted at all but rather rubbed along the vulva, clitoris, penis, perineum or anywhere you like. Some of these have a uniform smooth surface and are sometimes called Smoothies; they can be used for external stimulation or for vaginal penetration, but they’re not safe for anal insertion since they don’t have a base to keep them from slipping all the way inside. That’s why there is a specialty item called a “Base Booster” available that you can slip onto any vibrator to make it anal-safe. They are silicone, come in various sizes, and have a good grip.



Have you ever heard of “The Rabbit”? The TV show Sex in the City put this vibrator on the map. The Rabbit entered pop culture that day and never went back in the closet! It’s a style known as “Twice as Nice,” designed with a shaft plus a clitoral vibrator together in one unit; each element can be controlled separately. It can be inserted into the vagina and stimulates outside too, simultaneously providing clitoral and vaginal pleasure. The original Rabbit Pearl has a swiveling shaft with a cluster of pearls protruding midway up its length—these will be positioned well for G-spot stimulation, for some—and a bunny attached to its base whose fluttering rabbit ears tickle and stimulate the clit. There are countless vibrator choices in this style. Some are rechargeable, some waterproof, some have remote controls, not to mention their variety of sizes with longer, shorter, or fatter shafts. Some are more bendable or less, some have more fluttery parts around the clit and some don’t. They don’t all have a rabbit shape, either; some of them include clitoral stimulators that look like other critters, or are vaguely flower-bud-like. In choosing one of these, your most important question might not be whether you like rabbits and want one nuzzling your clitoris, but rather, how long is your optimal shaft. If you choose one in this style that’s too long for your comfort, the clitoral attachment won’t reach your clit—and that’s the whole point of this special toy!





Electric Vibrators (Massager-style):


Joani Blank created Good Vibrations in the 1970s to put one specific vibrator in the hands of the people: the Magic Wand, recommended by Betty Dodson even before that. It is still one of our best-selling vibrators. It’s strong and has a particular low vibration that many people find especially pleasurable. Until 2015, when a rechargeable version hit the market, it still plugged into the wall—very old-school by 21st century standards! But there are other electric vibes on the market, including the Swedish massager and coil styles. These are the kind of vibrators you are likely to find, without any reference to their orgasm-inducing properties, sold in department stores.



“Do not use on unexplained calf pain”—huh?



If you read the fine print on your vibrator box or the informational insert that came when you purchased it, you might read the puzzling words “Do not use on unexplained calf pain.” In general, vibration is good for you, and it can allay pain. But “unexplained calf pain” is a special case. This type of pain might result from a blood clot in one of the large veins in the leg, and using a vibrator on it would run the risk of dislodging the clot. This would potentially lead to a serious medical emergency. So—vibrate your pleasure parts, not your legs!





Make a U Turn




	 The “U-Turn” style is related to the “Twice As Nice” vibes, in that it stimulates clitorally and vaginally at the same time. It has no shaft, however—it looks like a “U.” The first vibrator to promote this style was created for solo use and allowed the wearer to simply insert it, then rock back and forth, creating simultaneous internal motion and external vibration. The best-known of this style is the We-Vibe, which took the basic “U-Turn” style and furthered the design so it would be able to fit comfortably into the vagina during penetrative intercourse. This variation allows the partner’s penis to get as much stimulation from the vibrator as the wearer’s G-spot and clitoris will.





Hold My Hand




The Palm style is not designed for insertion at all; it’s held in the hand, or in some cases fits right into a pair of panties, so it can be positioned over the vulva and clitoris. Many versions of this style have a curve built in that allows it to closely hug the vulva. This one can also be used on the penis.





Put a Ring on It




	 Some small vibrators have a cock ring built onto them so they can be worn on the penis during intercourse. These can also, of course, be used on a dildo, a couple of fingers, or even another shaft-style vibrator, which turns it into a do-it-yourself “Twice as Nice.”





G Whiz




	 G-spot vibes have a pronounced curve, making it easier to find and stimulate the famed spot. Some like the feel of a curved shaft regardless of whether they’re going for G-spot thrills or simply prefer the extra sensation the curve adds. The range of size and curve varies greatly, from simply a tilted tip on a Smoothie style to an S-curved toy, and many options in between.





Mighty Minis




	 Mini-vibes often resemble the smooth shaft style, but are much smaller. Some look like the Rabbit Pearl’s bunny detached from the shaft, or some other cute animal shape. Some are tiny bullets. Watch battery technology has allowed vibrators to become much smaller, which makes them wonderfully portable and travel-friendly. In all cases, even if these are not as strong as their large counterparts, they may feel extra-intense, especially right on the clitoris, since the size of your vibrator’s surface area may affect your response almost as much as its strength or other features: with small or pointed vibes, all the stimulation is focused on a limited area and while fewer nerve endings come to the party, they get all the action.





Music Hath Charms




Tune-style vibrators access your music via your favorite mobile device and/or respond to whatever music is playing in the room, vibrating in time to the beat. One company, OhMiBod, makes a variety of these vibrators designed specifically for music lovers.





Vibes Incognito




	 These vibes are creatively made to look like something else—like the famous I Rub My Duckie, a rubber duck indistinguishable from the regular yellow duck floating in your tub —except for the on-off switch! This adorable little quacker also comes in a number of frisky designs, including one dressed as Santa and packaged in a clear tree ornament, and another in bondage, and one in a feather boa with a Swarovski crystal nose—er, beak—piercing. There are vibes shaped like lipstick or a powder-and-mirror compact that look like they belong in a makeup bag. Some can be recharged while others use batteries. Obviously this type of toy might be a good choice if you want to keep your vibration discreet. If your toddler finds the rubber duckie vibe and locates the switch, you can always say, “That’s so the duck can make waves, honey!” You won’t be lying to the little darling, either.

We’ve seen everything from Hello Kitty to cupcake-shaped vibrating toys come through our doors. Rest assured that if we stock them at Good Vibrations they are body-safe, in addition to giving you a pop-culture giggle.





“For Novelty Use Only”


You can buy a sex toy in any number of places—a toy you fully intend to use, and use with sexual gusto—and see that its box reads “For Novelty Use Only.” What does this even mean?



It’s complicated, not to mention confusing. Historically, some toy distributors included this disclaimer to discourage people from holding them liable if a sex toy mishap occurred: “What do you mean? That was a gag gift for the bachelorette party! No one was supposed to use it—we said so right on the box!” Another reason is that some jurisdictions required such language to allow a vibrator or dildo to be sold in their area: not for health reasons, but for sex-negative reasons—as if the entire town was in on the idea that a sex toy was shameful and ought only be purchased as a joke.

Newer, better-made vibrators are less likely to show this disclaimer, but when you do see it, just read it as an artifact from a time when vibes were less than acceptable purchases, and be glad that we are now living when shame-based feelings about sexual pleasure and the products that enhance it are finally fading.

These are the days of premium vibrators, when a really fabulous vibe can cost northward of $200; it’s highly unlikely anyone will purchase something at that price as a bachelorette gag, and we have always been a little irritated by the notion that the items we carefully choose and even more carefully teach about and sell would be called “novelties” and not “quality sex toys.”





So What Does Your Vibrator Say About You?


Already own a vibrator or two? What does your vibrator say about you? This quiz is for everyone and anyone. Instead of reading Tarot cards or leaving your fate up to the Magic 8 Ball, take this simple quiz and let us reveal what your vibrator—either the one you bought for yourself, or for a lover—says about you!





1) The Magic Wand


Your turkey at Thanksgiving may not be perfect but by golly it’s cooked enough! You’re a no-nonsense trooper who knows what gets the job done (and done again).





2) U-Vibe: The Couple’s Vibe


Did someone say Cheesecake Factory?! You are ready to enjoy life’s indulgences and always able to look for ways to share the joy.





3) The Simple Smoothie Battery Vibe


You’re sleek, sophisticated and non-assuming. When you show up for a cocktail party no one knows if your outfit cost $50 or $500—and that’s how you like it!





4) The Rechargable Lipstick Vibe


No one at work knows you pretend you’re Foxy Brown or 007 when you sneak up the back staircase for a quickie. You have expensive taste and lovers in every port—if you even bother with lovers, that is.





5) The App-Controlled Remote Vibe


The Bloombergs call you for advice. You’re earthy enough to care about the environment yet savvy enough never to put down your mobile device. Who knew that you could fuck your lover across the ocean?! Well, actually, you did.

OK, OK! Taking quizzes and reading about ourselves can be great fun, but in reality your vibrator choice tells us nothing about you. People of all genders, body sizes, and sexualities and people residing anywhere in the world can like any and all of these choices. We are only limited by our imaginations, so have fun and be free!





Good, Better, Best


Speaking of quality, and of premium vibrators: The 21st century is the era when vibrators have really morphed from mass-produced novelties to beautifully-designed luxury items. Many new companies have joined the old stalwarts who produced jillions of Smoothies and kazillions of vibes that looked like butterscotch-colored dongs, as well as the groundbreakers who imported Japanese styles like the Rabbit Pearl. These days, higher-quality imported vibrators come not just from Japan but also from Europe, and most of them are clad not in questionable materials—what an old staffer used to call “mystery rubber”—but in silicone; or they’re made of smooth, recyclable metals. Not only that, but a few manufacturers are now also using techniques similar to those used in restaurants—i.e., hairnets, gloves, etc.—to make sure that the toy you get is hygienically clean and ready for use.

When Good Vibrations selects which vibrators to sell, we look at price, quality, design, functionality and safety: the whole item and all its elements. A core value of our company is to offer a range of accessibly-priced products, because people on fixed incomes deserve orgasms too! We don’t carry just any ol’ toy. We choose these toys just as carefully as we do our higher-priced items. We believe that quality should come in a range of prices. We find great affordable products for our customers, no matter what their budgets. So we offer many choices. The higher-priced toys are manufactured with materials or advanced mechanics that are built to last longer. Often you will find these items packaged elegantly, which can affect the price. Maybe that’s not necessary if you want it by your bedside ready to go; on the other hand, maybe you want a beautiful treat for your body and your eyes, or a gift for someone you love. Different occasions or needs will help you decide what’s right for you. The quality of these toys is evident even before you turn them on, because the care that has gone into their design and manufacture is clearly visible.

Will a pricier toy give you a better orgasm? That’s not something we can guarantee! So we speak in terms of “good, better, and best”-quality when we introduce you to the items we carry; each one is selected with an eye to its overall form, function, body-safe materials and more. We strive to offer enough styles to choose from that you can always find the type of toy/s you want.





Love Myself, Love My Vibrator: Vibrator Care for Long Life


Battery-operated vibes need to be opened carefully when you insert or remove the batteries. Read any instructions before you open the case, as some vibes easily break if opened wrong.

Do not use silicone lube on silicone vibrators without first covering them with a condom. We recommend using a water-based lube instead.

Thoroughly clean and dry toys after use. Toys made from permeable materials can be covered with a condom to keep them clean.

If you want to share a toy with someone else or use it for anal and vaginal play, either wash it in between partners or orifices or cover it with a fresh condom each time you switch.

Avoid dropping the vibrator. The plastic parts can crack or break.

Store your batteries outside the vibrator to avoid accidentally leaving the vibrator on low. This is especially important when traveling—a vibrating suitcase can delay your trip through airport security!

If your toy isn’t waterproof, be careful to avoid getting water inside it.

Clean non-waterproof vibrators by wiping with a cloth moistened with water and/or soap and water. Follow with a clear-water-only cloth “rinse” so your toy doesn’t carry soap residue.

If there is a cord between the battery pack and the vibrator, do not tug on it or use it to pull the vibe out of your body; it can break. Battery packs with removable bullets are ideal for this situation—they’re the best buy for bullet fans, as the battery pack tends to live the longest and the bullet usually dies due to stress on the cord.





Couples’ Toys


Let’s make something clear right from the start: Many, many couples use sex toys. In fact, there was an entire era when they were called “marital aids,” not “toys.” But somehow sex toys have gotten a reputation that they are only for masturbation. Of course most, if not all, sex toys can be used solo, by people of pretty much any gender or orientation. But all of them can be used by couples as well.

Practically as common at Good Vibrations as people looking for toys for themselves is the sometimes-nervous woman who wants a toy to share with her husband (one that won’t make him uncomfortable), or the guy who’s shopping not for himself, but for a dildo or vibrator to bring home to his wife or girlfriend to spice things up in the bedroom. Same-sex partners like to play with toys too; in fact, just as any solo person can enjoy toys, so can any couple. There aren’t specific toys that can only be used by couples—anyone can have fun with anything, if they’re creative and open to new experience—but some toys are designed with partner play in mind.

Here are some examples.

Dildos—toys meant to be inserted vaginally or anally—are common solo toys and are used in many couples’ bedrooms. Dildos paired with harnesses are primarily playthings for partners to use together, as they facilitate intercourse, no-hands penetration, and the like. Actually, calling them “playthings” is only true for some harness-wearers; for others, being able to wear a dildo is an absolutely serious, as well as sexy, extension of their gender identity. Some people even call them “tools,” not toys. A dildo and harness can be worn by a man for pleasuring his female or male partner, by women pleasuring other women or men, and by all trans folk, pleasuring anyone else. In short: Dildos and harnesses are not just for lesbians!

Then there are double dildos, from the old-school “two dongs stuck together” design to functional newer styles made for couples’ penetration play sans harness. These range from an angled V shape that allows two people access to each end of the dildo in a more natural intercourse position, to doubles that allow one partner to “hold” the dildo vaginally or anally by means of an egg-shaped piece that stays in their body, plus a phallic or artistic shape meant for inserting into their partner.



Any person with a penis can use a vibrating cock ring; if worn during intercourse the vibrations can give clitoral stimulation at the same time. Vibrating rings, as well as the vibe-less clit stimulator rings with bumps or texturing, are primarily designed to add extra sensation during intercourse. Many couples use them this way and never even realize they might fly solo, but vibrating “cock” rings can be wrapped around fingers, or snuggled up against the coronal ridge, which is the part of the penis most sensitive to vibration. They can be slid onto a dildo shaft, too, and used this way with a partner or alone.

Some kinds of vibrators, such as U-shaped vibes, are designed to enhance intercourse by fitting inside a vagina against the G-spot, then curving out to rest on the clitoris, with such a narrow neck that a penis (or dildo) can usually slide right in beside it. These vibes can also be worn underneath a harness to give the wearer more sensation.



Many clitoral vibes are also ideal for use during intercourse, including finger-held vibrators; longer, slimmer vibrators that fit between partners; and palm-held vibes, which either partner can slide between bodies for more direct clitoral stimulation.



Vibrators that are wearable and remote-controlled are tailor-made for twosomes—someone else holds the remote or uses an app that controls the vibrator. Couples use these in different ways, from going out dancing together or for use during fantasy play at home.



Partnered sex can be jazzed up when one or both parties wear stay-in-place anal toys like butt plugs. Some people who have a harder time coming to orgasm during intercourse may use these to add more sensation. Others just like the way anal fullness or prostate stimulation feels while they’re doing other sexy things with their lover.

Sex position furniture was created with couples in mind. It’s designed to facilitate varying intercourse and oral sex positions. In addition to this use, these items function to add comfort, supporting people with a variety of abilities and body shapes. More reliable and sturdy than your bedroom pillows, they can help ease sex after injury or illness, allowing for a variety of positions that otherwise might not be available to many people. But these pieces are useful to anyone. With regard to your favorite sex act or position, “Why be uncomfortable or go without?” is the sentiment with position furniture.



As we’ve said before, couples do more than have intercourse, and many products, regardless of whether you think of them as sex toys, are designed to be used by partners who are exploring various kinds of sensuality, from the luxurious—massage oils, bars, and candles—to the explicit—flavored lubricants or body lickables—to the potentially intense—BDSM toys like bondage gear and impact toys like canes, whips, and paddles. Sexy garments, from lingerie to costumes, can also be thought of as a kind of couple’s “toy,” and many partners dress up, then undress, making striptease part of erotic play.

And again, it’s worth remembering that almost any toy, even if it’s an ideal masturbation plaything, can also be shared by two, or more than two. This is not limited to items like vibrators, dildos or penis sleeves. Erotic books and erotic movies can add sexiness as well as arousal for couples during their intimate time together.





Bringing Toys Into Partner Play


Many people want to be able to share their sex toys with their lover, or let the toy add new stimulation so both can enjoy partner sex even more. When suggesting toy play, as with any new sexual experience, focus on positive reasons: No one gets turned on to—or is even comfortable with—a new idea when it’s presented as, “You can’t give me orgasms, I’m bringing Wanda to bed.” Whether Wanda is your vibrator or your girlfriend, there is no spoonful of sugar in that communication! Even those who fear their partner will feel threatened or jealous of a sex toy—the “I should be all you ever want or need” type—should know that many people who start out dubious end up loving vibrators, penis sleeves, and other sexy playthings.

So try some of these ways to introduce Wanda, or whatever plaything you’d like to add to the erotic menu:

“I am so curious about what using a sex toy would be like, and I want to find out when I’m with you.”

“I used a vibrator [or whatever] before we met and it was fun—let’s try it together and see if you enjoy it too!”

“I read in a magazine that picking out a sex toy together can bring a couple closer. Why don’t we do that?”

“Have you ever used a sex toy or wanted to try one? What kind?”

“Did you know that a lot of guys really like vibrators?”

“I know I don’t always want to have intercourse when you want to, so how about if we try using a sleeve together?”

The main focus of all these messages is erotic adventure or curiosity, plus keeping sexiness and intimate engagement in the partnership. Another fun tactic is to agree to say one thing each of you would like to try; that way, each partner has a stake in suggesting that you explore together. Agree to each pick out the sex toy of their choosing! And if you’re really players—Scrabble, cards, whatever—let the winner choose the kind of sex, or the toy, for that night.

Of course, you can add toys by just bringing one home, or giving one to your partner. Sometimes this works perfectly; when your partner is open to new experiences and curious about toys, the erotic plaything’s integration into your sex life can be seamless. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always go so easily. For someone who’s a bit sexually conservative, or even defensive, the message a toy delivers might be, “I’m not enjoying sex with you like I used to” or “You aren’t enough for me.” Even if you have problems in your relationship, you get nowhere fast if your partner opens a gift box and immediately cries, “You don’t love me the way I am/our sex life the way it is,” or “I can’t compete with that!” or “I’m not that type of person!”

So, as with any kind of new adventure, talking about sex more, finding out your partner’s feelings about different activities, and helping them feel invested in having more fun and exploration together is key. You can’t assume you know someone’s perspective if they’ve never spelled it out to you, so involve them in the discussion. This adds intimacy to your life, anyhow—it’s a good thing whether or not you ever come home with that special toy.

Some misunderstandings play into people’s concerns about toys; we’ve addressed these issues elsewhere, but this would be a good time to recap:

—Many people think intercourse is the primary focus of sex, and that nothing else is all that important.

—Many believe orgasm with intercourse is natural and people who don’t climax have some kind of problem.

—Some people believe the size or firmness of a partner’s penis is the most important factor giving the other person pleasure, and therefore assume if a sex toy is desired their penis must be too small or not hard enough.

—Some think it’s the partner’s role to give the other pleasure, and this is the only legitimate way to get it.

—Some people believe masturbation is wrong or disapprove of their own partner masturbating, and a toy upsets them for that reason whether or not their partner was even intending to use the toy for solo sex.

None of these beliefs are true—they’re certainly not true for everyone. But sometimes partners with restricted ideas about what sort of sex is legitimate may need extra information, perhaps a trusted friend or advisor to help them understand it’s okay to expand sexual practices and potential, or even a session or more with a sex therapist. In general (though mileage may vary), a partner with conservative ideas about sex toys is also likely to have specific ideas about what kind of sex is okay, whether that means to them normal or allowable or legitimate.

Most people who are concerned with this issue are probably more worried than the situation warrants, because sex toys are becoming more commonly-used and more “normalized” all the time. Not every person or couple needs to try them or will enjoy them. At the same time, toys are available for any person or couple wanting to explore a variety of sensations, enjoy new erotic feelings and kinds of play, and spice up their sexual relationship. So, hooray for toys!





Ben Wa Balls, Pleasure Balls, Kegel Balls, Vaginal Balls


Call them what you will—these spheres are notorious sex toys with a long history; at least, they’re advertised that way. The story varies, but it goes something like this: The original Ben Wa balls are reputed to be “the ancient sex secret of Asia”—supposedly one inserts them into the vagina, where the balls tap together and generate vibrations resulting in hours of pleasure! In reality, the Ben Wa balls you can buy today are small brass-colored metal balls about the diameter of a tampon—you know what a pleasure fest those are (we might need to point out to some of the fellas that we’re joking)—and the vagina closes gently around them once they’re inserted, holding them as would a lightly clenched fist. They don’t roll around like it’s a cave, tapping and bumping into each other and generating those vibes—and even if they did it would be more of a tap-tap, not a vibration. Some people think that originally Ben Wa balls were used inside the vagina for a man’s pleasure, for his penis to rub against during intercourse.

Ben Was are good for developing one’s focus on the more subtle sensations inside the vagina. You can squeeze down on them with your PC muscles; most other pleasure balls are larger in diameter, so if you can actually feel and tune into the real Ben Wa sensations, you’re pretty darned tuned in! And some people like having intercourse with Ben Was inserted. Uncircumcised men, beware: Those balls will pinch if your foreskin slips in between them. Vaginal balls got a boost in trendiness from the Ben Wa scenes in 50 Shades of Grey, but they don’t have to be thought of as a kinky sex toy; for many users, they’re more of a health and function accessory. These won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but that’s why tea comes in so many flavors!

Nowadays most people like “pleasure balls” or “Kegel balls” which are larger than their marble-sized Ben Wa predecessors and are usually connected with a string. That’s very handy because removing balls without strings requires squatting, bearing down, and sometimes fishing them out with a finger. Many of these pleasure balls do provide a vibration variant. Some of them are hollow balls with another smaller ball inside the first, which means there is motion, a movement of weight and some vibration when these inner balls roll around. These larger balls may provide vaginal, and especially G-spot, stimulation.

When you squeeze down on pleasure balls, the muscles you use are the Kegels, a.k.a. PC (pubococcygeal) muscles. That’s why many people choose Kegel balls to help them do PC exercises. When the balls are attached by a string, you can insert one or two balls inside, then tug the string while tightening against the balls—this provides stronger resistance. Some Kegel exercisers are developed to use in a graduated manner—a three-device set, with each successive ball requiring a stronger vaginal grip. The balls also stimulate via their girth—like dildos, they provide a feeling of fullness and, when the string is used, some movement. This is the form of sensation many vaginas feel most acutely, because the vaginal nerves beyond the first third of its length are more attuned to pressure, motion, and fullness.





How to Play with Your Balls


They’re fun and sexy, most find them easy to wear, and they lend themselves to erotic adventure—wear them around the house, or when getting spanked or fondled, for fun on the train, while receiving or giving oral sex, or when exploring other erotic options. Pulling on them rhythmically, if they have an attached string, can be highly arousing. Many people like to wear them and tug gently on them while simultaneously using a vibrator. Some insert them before strapping on a dildo and harness—they’re an easy way to add sensation for the harness-wearer.





Trans Toys & Gender Expression


Anybody, with any body, can potentially use and enjoy most sex toys. As we pointed out in the GPS section when we discussed homologues—the way “male” and “female” genitals have fundamental similarities—many body parts have common sensation capacities and neurology, regardless of the gender of the person/s to which they’re attached. Trans and genderqueer toy users might like many of the same kinds of sensations and products as cis male or female users.

At the same time, some trans users have specific needs or desires from their toys or sexual products: they want these items to support their gendered sexual expression. In our early years, Good Vibrations carried nothing like this, except “realistic”-looking dildos which didn’t function as well as trans men wanted them to. The entire world of adult products had yet to catch up to the needs of trans customers. Since then there have been definite innovations in the field of products made with genderqueer/queer/trans markets and individuals in mind, especially people who want/need/desire more realism and comfort in their strap-on sex. Dildos, packers and harnesses all include product options today that may be especially well-suited for trans male users.

Why? There are two main reasons. Those who didn’t choose or didn’t have access to sex realignment surgery, were looking for something—anything—that would lend itself to a more embodied experience during intercourse and other sex play with their partners. Non-realistic silicone, no matter how good the quality, didn’t do the trick, and non-silicone realistic dildos weren’t an ideal alternative; their size and texture were often cited as problematic by trans and genderqueer customers. Often it was these customers and staff who, fueled by personal desire, did the research and development and pushed companies to make these products, or in some cases got entrepreneurial and made them themselves. The major companies in the adult industry weren’t supporting these communities with innovative products, so they began doing it for themselves.

Some of the items that were created work great for transmasculine folks but also are fantastic for anybody wanting more realism in their sex play. Hence items created by these companies, or in some cases individual people, for other queers wound up pleasing a whole range of customers and further driving innovation, proving that quality and sensation are important to people of all identities! Cottage industry thus solved issues that were not even on these larger companies’ radar.

Good Vibrations itself was part of this change not only because we were an obvious place for shoppers to look for products like these. That was only half of the story. In addition, some people who worked at Good Vibrations either transitioned or had lovers, partners and friends who transitioned and therefore were searching for appropriate products. We and a few other women-owned “sex” stores added items for gender expression because there was nowhere else to get these items. The Soft Pack, for example, wasn’t really a logical fit for a store that specialized in vibrators and dildos, but when our lovers/friends wanted something to pack with, voila!—this item quickly earned a place on our shelves.

Trans women have a specific product need as well: dilators are needed after vaginoplasty; and dildo use, in addition to or instead of intercourse with a partner, can help support vaginal health and prevent shrinkage. We have long recommended silicone dildos, chosen with a few size gradations, to our trans women customers who otherwise would have had only inflexible and less-aesthetic medical versions to choose from.

Speaking of aesthetics, this is the other element wherein products can support gender identity. Fabric brief or boxer brief harnesses, in addition to their superior comfort, can be designed with more masculine or feminine touches. We have begun to carry ranges of lingerie and boudoir items in our stores partly because this is an easy way to support the erotic and gendered identity of our trans women and cross-dressing customers, not to mention making foxy gifts and garments available to everyone else who finds them appealing.





Dildos


	Finding the Right One for You


Yes, Goldilocks, Size Does Matter. Maybe. The most important characteristic to think about when selecting your dildo is probably size. If it’s too small, it might not give you the zing of pleasure that your “just right” size would. If it’s too big, you won’t be able to use it comfortably. One easy way to gauge what size dildo you might like is to consider the number of fingers you like inside you, or call up memories of a partner’s penis that worked well in the past. Even the most aroused penis becomes firmer and softer during sex, so remember, this is an estimate. Whether it was fingers, a dildo or a penis, you probably didn’t have a measuring tape out that night! This is where the time-tested cucumber test comes in handy:

Take a trip to your local produce store, or back yard if you grow a vegetable garden, to shop for cucumbers—or, if you prefer, zucchinis.

Select a few cucumbers or squash of different sizes to give you some choices.

If your veggie isn’t organic it’s a good idea to either peel it or wash it well and cover it with a condom, since natural insecticides contained in all vegetables, plus added waxes and pesticides, should stay outside the body.

You might want to warm it slightly in the microwave or in a bowl of warm water, especially if it’s been in the fridge.

If the cuke or zuke is too big, shave it down until it fits comfortably. You could even carve it to form a nice G-spot curve or a head. We don’t offer “sex toy vegetable sculpture” classes in our stores, but please feel free to get crafty at home.

Once you’ve found the right width and length, whip out that measuring tape. Measure the length and then cut the cumber in half to measure the width (diameter). Note these measurements for your shopping adventure.



Veggie Disclaimer—While using a cucumber or zucchini vaginally is fine, there’s an important caveat: we don’t recommend it for anal play. Since it doesn’t have a base, it could slide all the way in, especially when it’s covered with lube or if it breaks.



Why did we say that penis size doesn’t really matter, but that dildo size does? We did say that penis size matters to some people; certainly some of us will be able to cite our ideal penile length and girth (and maybe shape, too) if we’ve had a bit of experience with variation among cocks. But many of us also say that what’s most important is the person attached! This is true for many reasons, but we’ll call out two ways a dildo can’t compare: We don’t have a full-on relationship with it—no flirting, joking, sharing our thoughts, or pillow talk—and we can’t get extra sexual experiences from it beyond those limited things it does, and does well: insertion, getting strapped on. Often we choose a dildo for its size and shape; what we see is what we get. With a human, companionship and erotic experience can occupy so many other realms that penis size literally may not matter.





Shape




Dildos comes in many sizes and shapes. Some are short and girthy. Some are long and slim. Some are long and big around. Some are smooth while others are textured. Curved dildos may work well for G-spot or prostate play. Some are called “realistic,” looking more like penises—some even have balls. And some come with ridges or bumps for extra sensation. If your toy has ridges or bumps, it’ll feel bigger and might be too rough for anal play—and some vaginas don’t enjoy those speed bumps either, especially not before they’re fully revved up.

Dildos with a flat base can be used anally or with a harness. If you are planning on using a harness with your dildo, note that about a half inch of the length will be taken up by the harness as the toy fits through its hole or straps. Some harness-able dildos are designed to accommodate a vibrator in the base. Some are designed so the bottom of the base has ridges or texturing. Both these styles add a little extra oomph for the person wearing the dildo and may offer extra sensation for the receiver.



Built For the Job Sex toys can be made from all kinds of materials—plastic; ceramic; metal; wood; tempered glass; silicone; rubber and elastomer (including softskin)—and each has fans and different sensations to deliver. But maybe what you’re most interested in is texture: Hard. Shiny. Matte. Firm. Flexible. Metallic. Soft. These textures will affect a toy’s feel, and consequently how you feel about the toy, so keep that in mind as well.

Rubber or Elastomer Rubber and elastomer dildos can be inexpensive, which makes them a good choice for a “starter” toy if you’ve never used dildos before or you’re not sure what size to get. Both materials vary in overall quality, durability and price.

They can be more or less difficult to clean, since there’s a range of permeability to their surfaces. We highly recommend covering all rubber toys with a condom, even if you’re the only person using it. Two other disadvantages to rubber toys: They may be too flexible for some people’s taste, and the material doesn’t last long. When they’re new, rubber toys often smell like plastic, but that goes away just as it does with a new shower curtain.

If your primary concern is short-term cost or you don’t want to invest in something you don’t know if you like yet, then rubber is a good choice.

Elastomer also doesn’t break the bank—toys made from this material can be higher-quality than some rubbers. Elastomer toys look similar to rubber, but are not quite as shiny. The ones Good Vibrations carries are phthalate-free and latex-free and compatible with both water-based and silicone-based lubricants. Please note: Most sex toys are made from a range of polymers, some of which are elastomers: a material that has both flexibility and compressibility. Elastomers come both food-grade and non-food-grade qualities. The adult industry uses the term to refer to this particular range of soft materials.





Softskin


Softskin is a remarkably realistic-seeming material that has just the right blend of firm and flexible, usually designed to look as well as feel like a penis. Some don’t want their dildos to feel or appear penis-y—but some definitely do.

Cleaning softskin can be a bit tricky. It’s a permeable material, so you definitely want to cover softskin with a condom, particularly if you plan to share it. After being washed and dried, softskin gets sticky. There are two ways to deal with this: You can store your dry softskin dildo in a plastic bag so no dust or other material can adhere to it, or you can dust it with cornstarch, which will dry out the surface.

If you go with cornstarch, the easiest method is to put the dildo and a spoonful of cornstarch in a bag and shake it up. Just be sure to rinse it off before using it again, because cornstarch absorbs lubrication and gets gritty. And never use talcum powder, since it has been linked with ovarian cancer. Use water-based lubricant only with softskin dildos—some silicone lubricants will damage this material.





Silicone


We highly recommend silicone due to its quality and durability, plus its flexibility, ability to quickly warm to body temperature, and range in prices. These toys also come in a variety of designs, from the highly stylized to the simple and from “realistic” to curved, bumpy, and vibrating.

Silicone is among the most body-safe materials. It is also non-permeable and hypoallergenic, can be easily cleaned and disinfected, and is quite durable. Silicone blends may not be of the same quality. Silicone toys will last almost forever, unless the surface gets punctured. If that happens, the rip will spread until your toy falls apart. Make sure that you keep your toys away from sharp fingernails, edges of counters, and pets. A high-quality silicone dildo is not a doggie chew toy, but we have met dogs that would beg to differ!

Some silicone lubricants bond on a molecular level to silicone toys, which can damage the toy’s surface. To ensure your quality silicone dildo lasts as long as possible, we recommend using a water-based lube instead, or cover your toys with a condom.

While silicone is a great material, what if you love the way softskin feels? Well, don’t fret! There are other options, thanks initially to the fine minds at Vixen Creations, a women-owned dildo manufacturer. The women and trans men who worked there didn’t feel like regular silicone was enough, especially for highly realistic dildos and packing toys (these are soft dildos good for gender presentation but not always firm enough for many sexual activities). They invented VixSkin™, a marvelous 100% silicone formula that feels like softskin and cleans like silicone.





Tempered Glass and Acrylic


If you like elegance, have a penchant for art, and love the feel of smooth surfaces, then you might be the perfect candidate for a glass, metal or acrylic dildo. When we say glass we don’t mean to imply dangerous or scary. Unlike your best crystal, these won’t shatter during use! They are usually gorgeous collectables, often lovingly made by artisans in the USA. Glass toys tend to be slimmer than toys made from other materials. The harder a toy is, the larger it may feel when in use, so something very rigid like glass often comes in a smaller size. Their extreme firmness can do wonders for the G-spot or prostate. You can angle them to go exactly where you want the firmest pressure, using your hands or a lover’s. We never recommend using them in a harness, however—nor those made of wood, acrylic, or metal, either. One mis-aimed thrust could really hurt. These are such hard materials that’s it’s best to have optimum control over the angle and depth of penetration.

The technology for glass toys has become highly advanced, with manufacturers creating designs as attractive as they are arousing. Some have ridged surfaces to add subtle texture. Others are gently curved, making them ideal for G-spot and prostate play. There are even some with 24 karat gold details.

Quality glass toys are made of borosilicate—just like bakeware that doesn’t chip or break with everyday use—or soda-lime glass—like a pint jar or window glass. The latter cannot withstand extreme temperatures, but you can warm, or cool, a toy made of soda-lime glass by placing it into a bowl of moderate-temperature water—think about a warm bath or cool swimming pool. Glass toys have a super-slick surface, so a little lubricant goes a long way. Silicone lubes are especially good with glass toys for an amazingly slippery combination. While glass toys from reputable makers are safe, they need to be carefully maintained nevertheless; if they are dropped on, or hit by, something hard like tile or metal, they can change internally and lose their tempering, so take care. At this point they are vulnerable to breakage. If you do drop your glass toy, don’t continue to use it for insertion; consider it a sexy paperweight.

Acrylic, a hard plastic, shares many of the qualities of glass, and is even less likely to break. Acrylic toys should be washed in warm water, since hot water can cause micro-cracks in the surface, clouding the toy.





Metal


Just like glass toys, metal dildos and butt plugs are very rigid, which magnifies even the smallest motion. Some people love the smoothness and lack of friction these toys offer. The first metal toy that Good Vibrations carried, and that we know of, was the Kegelcisor; subsequently Betty Dodson designed the Barbell, both created to help you do your Kegels. Made with surgical-grade stainless steel, these are still recommended for strengthening the pelvic floor. But beautifully-designed metal toys for pleasure soon followed. The elegant C-curve of the Pure Wand is a hands-down, or perhaps we should say hands-on, favorite among seekers of the G-spot. Metal toys were raised to new heights with the Eleven, a smooth, heavy dildo whose 11 inches are shaped and curved in a sexy, sophisticated way. Metal toys work well with any lubricant, especially silicone formulas. You can also warm or cool them in water for varying sensations. As with glass, if you heat or cool metal toys, please make sure the water is a safe temperature for your skin.

Now that you’ve got the information about dildos, if you’re in the mood for vaginal or anal penetration, you’ll be sure to find one that strikes your fancy and hits the right spot!





Harnesses


Material


Leather is a great material for harnesses, as it gets softer and more comfortable with age, and many people love the way it looks and feels against the skin. Leather can be cleaned with leather oils and cleaners or a damp cloth and soap, but should not get wet. Much good sex is wet, of course—if your leather harness gets sexy, fluid goodness on it, wipe it down as soon as the fun is over and let it air-dry. If leather is cared for properly, it will provide years of use. However, it cannot be disinfected. Also, it will stretch a bit when the harness is new; you may have to adjust the straps more often during that process.

We happily report that all the rest of the materials used for making the harness styles listed below are vegan, and most are more easily washable.

Vinyl harnesses can either be high-sheen or more subdued and leather-looking. No matter what the finish, vinyl harnesses are attractive and can last as long as leather. Vinyl is flexible and movable, water-resistant, can be cleaned with soap and water, and contains no animal byproducts.

Another choice is soft, stretchy fabric, including nylon, spandex, and cotton, with a ring built in to hold the dildo; these harnesses are comfy and attractive, with the style and comfort of undergarments while still being durable and functional. Among these are feminine looks inspired by panties or foundation garments, adorned with cut-outs, bows, and ruching, as well as masculine styles like briefs and boxers which are discreet and comfortable under clothing. All styles are easy on/off, washable, and smooth enough to wear as underwear. They’re ready for action!

Recycled and upcycled materials are sometimes used to make harnesses. We’ve seen biker styles, “rockabilly” styles and more. Some companies want to appeal to the pegging crowd or other niche markets—meaning they make styles they feel will make a girlie-girl and her guy happy.

Nylon and fabric harnesses are affordable and machine-washable, but should not be put in the dryer. These materials can be worn in the shower, pool and hot tub. They are lightweight and travel well. They’re great for people with multiple partners, as they’re easy to wash. They contain no animal byproducts.





Harness Styles


A single-strap harness has one strap between the legs, like a G-string. This middle strap puts direct pressure on the wearer’s genitals. You’ll have more control if you wear it cinched tightly, but some people dislike the feel of the center strap—while for others, it’s stimulating. The strap can get in the way if and when the wearer is on the receiving end of genital stimulation—if your partner decides to pleasure you while you’re wearing a one-strap harness, vaginal or clitoral accessibility may be limited.

A two-strap harness fits something like a jockstrap, with leg straps around the buttocks for greater control and adjustability rather than a strap that goes right between the wearer’s legs. Many people find them more comfortable. The straps may need to be adjusted if you change positions, but this style leaves the genitals more accessible.

A low-riding harness means that the ring is placed lower on the pubic bone, making it easier to maneuver and providing pressure on all the right spots.

Thigh harnesses wrap around the leg, rather than the hips. They work great if you want to sit still while your partner straddles your leg. Two women can each wear a thigh harness for simultaneous penetration. Or wrap one around a chair or pillow so your dildo can be used hands-free.

As mentioned above in the materials section, some harnesses are made in specific undergarment styles like boxer briefs, panties or jock straps.

So those are the basic styles. When shopping for a harness you might also want to consider other specifics that could affect your choice. A double-dildo-compatible harness allows the harness-wearer dildo penetration as well. It is designed to allow the user to unsnap the back from the front and insert two dildos or a double dildo.

Some harnesses allow the dildo’s base to rest against your skin; others have a backing which serves as a pad. Some wearers prefer to have this material between themselves and the toy, and some prefer to feel the stimulation of the dildo against their genitals and pubic area, especially when using one that vibrates. Harnesses with backings can be perfect for dildos with balls, as the balls fit in front of the backing, resulting in less pinching and pubic hair-pulling, and are less bulky than if worn behind the harness.

For added stimulation, you may want to consider a harness that has a pocket to hold a small vibe. This may increase stimulation for the harness-wearer and, depending on how it’s situated, for the one being penetrated as well.

Harnesses with D-rings have straps that slide through metal rings, making them fully adjustable and easy to tighten with one hand. They can be put on and taken off relatively quickly. Try looping the loose end into the harness’s waistband to secure it, since sometimes D-rings allow a little slippage.

Buckles are aesthetically pleasing and sturdy. A harness with buckles is guaranteed to hold its size, and once you’ve found the right hole to let it fit you optimally, you’ll know exactly where to buckle it to fit you securely. Remember, though, if it’s leather, there may be a couple of inches of stretch before you achieve your perfect fit.

The D-ring and buckle combo: Some harnesses have buckles around the waist and D-rings on the leg straps. This is a great combination for lightning-quick adjustments during sex.

The ring on the harness that the dildo goes through is called the O-ring. Some harnesses have permanent rings and some have rings that snap in and out, allowing you to change rings to accommodate varying-sized toys. Larger dildos may not fit into the permanent O-ring, which generally measures 1 ¾”. Be sure to check the diameter of the O-ring (if it is permanent) and the diameter of your favorite toy to make sure they are compatible. If the harness style allows for interchangeable O-rings, you can buy O-rings to fit your dildo and snap them into your harness.

Lastly there is a very useful little accessory called the O-stabilizer ring. It’s a solid foam ring which can be used to expand the base of your favorite dildo or toy to make it compatible with large-ring harnesses. Simply wet the ring, slide it on the dildo, let it dry and harness your dildo as you normally would. The widened base rests securely behind the O-ring for added stability, not to mention comfort! Foam rings can also be stacked on a dildo shaft to limit depth during penetration play.





Men Who Wear Harnesses


Cis men and trans men alike wear harnesses for many reasons, and that includes having choices when it comes to the variety of ways to have sexual intercourse. The Deuce has rings for both penis and dildo, great for folks who want to have different size options, don’t get erections, or want to continue intercourse after ejaculation. It’s also perfect for double penetration.





Sizing


Harnesses range between 23” to 72” around. Keep in mind that some people like to wear their harnesses on their waist, while most prefer that it sit low on the hips. Your preference can change the measurement you need. Decide how you want to wear your harness before you check the sizing.





Cock Rings


There are many reasons to love cock rings: Cock rings can make some erections last longer. Cock rings can make some erections firmer. Cock rings can vary penile sensation. Some rings have vibrators on them, which can enhance masturbation or partnered sex. Cock rings do not cure erectile dysfunction, and not everyone should use a cock ring.





How Do Cock Rings Work?


Cock rings restrict blood flow out of the penis; blood flowing in is what creates an erection. This creates sensations of pressure that many men find pleasurable (or anyone with a penis, for that matter—some trans women may use rings also). Cock rings are usually worn at the base of the penis, behind the scrotum, though some people wear them around the shaft of the penis only, especially rings that have a vibrator on them: these are often used to add sensation during partner sex, or can be worn closer to the head of the penis to enjoy the vibration where the most nerve endings are.

Although some people find that wearing a cock ring can make erections firmer or longer-lasting, we do not advise using cock rings for erectile difficulties unless advised to do so by a physician. Some of the conditions that can lead to erection problems can worsen from improper use of a cock ring, so it’s important to get a physical and your doctor’s go-ahead before experimenting with rings. If you are diabetic, have blood clotting concerns, or have any vascular or neural conditions, then this warning is doubly true for you!

Because of individual anatomical differences and different ring designs, cock rings don’t fit everyone equally, and you can get a pulled hair or feel discomfort from tightness if you’re not careful. You can also leave a ring on longer than is safe. To avoid discomfort and health problems, following is a guide to cock ring safety and pleasure.





Putting on a Cock Ring—and Getting it Off


It’s easier to put on a cock ring before your penis is fully erect. You might want to trim or shave the hair around the penis base and/or scrotum to decrease the likelihood of catching hair in the ring or snaps. We recommend wearing cock rings for no longer than they are comfortable, or twenty minutes, whichever is shorter. If you’re using a ring for the first time, you may want to remove it after five or ten minutes until you’re familiar with the various sensations cock rings provide. First-time users might want to experiment with the ring alone before using it with a partner.





“One Size Fits Most” Cock-Ring Sizing


Measure yourself first with a string, slipping it behind your testicles and pulling it up around the top of your erect penis where it meets your body. Mark where the string comes together and measure with a ruler—this measurement is your circumference. Now it’s time to get out your calculator! Divide by Pi (3.14) and this number will tell you the diameter of the cock ring that will fit you best.

For example:

5.5" circumference = 1 ¼" diameter

5.89" circumference = 1 ⅞" diameter

6.28" circumference = 2" diameter



Make sure the fit is right; if it’s too large, it won’t restrict the blood flow enough, while if it’s too small you won’t be able to get it on—or off! Use common sense; for instance, as metal rings don’t unsnap, we strongly recommend rubber or other flexible materials for your first cock rings, not metal. Take your time putting the ring on and taking it off, and use a small amount of lube to help it glide over your skin. If you feel discomfort, remove the ring immediately. If you have any hesitations about using a solid cock ring, don’t use one. There are many adjustable rings that might suit you better.





Styles of Cock Rings


Single-strap Cock Ring (Adjustable)


These cock rings can be made of leather, vinyl, or stretchier materials like neoprene or other types of rubber. They usually have snaps, or sometimes Velcro®, to make them adjustable. To put one on, place it behind the scrotum, against the body, and fasten over the top of the penis, then adjust for snugness. Because these are economical, easy to put on, and quickly removable if sensations become too intense, we recommend them for those trying cock rings for the first time. The Velcro® ones can adjust to the millimeter, which is a plus—on the other hand, they will not last as long as a snap-closure ring, since it’s a material that wears out over time; they are harder to clean, which can lead to the Velcro® not working properly; plus they can pull on pubic hair unless you’re trimmed or shaved.





Solid Stretchable Cock Ring


These are often a clear or translucent jelly-like material or some other rubber; in some cases they are a silicone blend; pure silicone isn’t very stretchy, though it’s great in other ways. These are also worn against the body, encircling both penis and testicles, though some men like them only on the shaft of the penis. Even though these may start out looking an inch or smaller in diameter, most of them are so stretchy they can fit over a hand. Unless they’re low-stretch, they can be put on with the penis hard or soft or anywhere in between. This gives you a lot of leeway in terms of putting the ring on—and of course it also makes it easier to take off.

Some of these rings are designed for clitoral stimulation. Vibrating rings are discussed below, or they may have a “love bump” or other clitoral protrusion built in, designed to directly contact the clit during intercourse.





Vibrating Cock Rings




Vibrating cock rings are generally a stretchy circle with a small bullet vibrator on one side; some have two vibes built in. Although they can be used for solo fun, these are often the first vibrator a woman brings home to a male partner as a couple’s toy. She may want to choose a vibrator she can share with her mate, and since this one is designed to ride on his penis while they have their fun, it may seem more pleasurable or less threatening to him than other kinds of toys. The idea is that the vibrator bumps up against a partner’s clitoris and gives her an orgasm during intercourse—which may or may not happen. They come in many colors and styles, sometimes inspired by the latest best-selling book or movie! We’ve seen them in red jelly-like rubber that had the bumpy vibrator equipped with vampire fangs; there is a whole set related to Alice in Wonderland; and some even have a miniature dolphin on them. While these styles might not last as long as the leather versions, they’re often economically priced, making them perfect for people looking to experiment with rings.



Vibrating cock rings aren’t usually adjustable, though most stretch enough to fit most penises and, for that matter, dildos. They can be worn behind the scrotum or in front. Some are snug enough to provide the squeezing sensation that makes cock rings popular, while others simply hold the vibrator in place, without much constriction. You can wear these toys solo—you may enjoy the vibration more if you snuggle it up under your coronal ridge—or during intercourse to pleasure your partner’s clitoris. Place the vibe on top of your penis for face-to-face positions and on the underside for rear entry. You can also wear the ring behind the scrotum with a vibrator underneath or behind your testicles for extra sensation during solo sex or sex with a partner—some people like this sensation a lot, and others not so much. You can also use a vibrating cock ring on a dildo, strapped on or not, or slip it over a couple of fingers so you won’t have to worry about dropping your vibrator at a key moment! These toys really are pretty versatile.

Two tips: The first time with a partner, have fun experimenting with different angles and positions and don’t have high orgasmic expectations: You’re exploring, finding out how it works for you. Be aware that if you’re moving back and forth and thrusting, the vibrator won’t be in contact with your partner’s clitoris all the time, and this might not provide enough consistent stimulation to cause orgasm; a technique to try in this case is deep enough penetration to get the vibe cuddled up to the clitoris, then very short in-and-out thrusts, so the vibe doesn’t go far. This may be the opposite technique than you usually use going for orgasm, but be patient—remember what we said earlier about the role of time and arousal! Slowing down the rush to orgasm can pay off with a stronger climax. On the other hand, some rings that have a vibrator vertical to the penis, allowing your partner to do some grinding or shallow in/out while still keeping in contact with the vibrator. This could also work for missionary but might involve some serious coordination—fortunately, this kind of experimentation tends to provide a lot of pleasure.





Solid Cock Rings—Not Adjustable


These are made of stainless steel or hard rubber, or even smooth wood, plastic, or Lucite. Only those who are experienced with other types of cock rings should use these, as they can be difficult to remove before ejaculation; it helps to know how you respond to the pressure of a ring before you put one on that might be difficult to get out of. Make sure the rigid material isn’t likely to crack or break; this could cause injury.

Putting on a solid ring: When the penis is soft, first tuck the testicles one at a time, and then the penis, through the ring. Once the penis is through, pull the ring up towards your body and adjust the whole “package” for comfort; many will find an erection happening almost immediately after the cock ring goes on, just from pressure. To remove from a flaccid penis, push penis back through the ring and “untuck” the testicles.

Lubricant can be helpful in removing solid cock rings from an erect penis; ejaculation, cold water or an ice compress will reduce the size of an erection and assist with removal. If the latter doesn’t sound like your idea of erotic fun, do think twice before getting a solid cock ring, since it’s dangerous to leave on for too long and you might have to resort to one of these methods! We recommend keeping a pair of blunt-tipped safety or paramedic scissors on hand to cut the ring, if necessary, but of course this will only work with hard rubber; metal and other materials will require a trip to the ER or a call to paramedics, or the local fire department—they have bolt cutters!—if you can’t get the erection down enough to get the ring off.

Solid cock rings are beautiful and elegant, but again: We recommend that only experienced cock ring wearers use them. Solid rings are not stretchy or adjustable, so please read the fitting instructions before using.





Testicle-spreader




If you like a firm grip between the legs and find ball play erotic then you might like a testicle spreader—the “spread” is not so far; for some people this product is more about the feeling of straps firmly holding them. Place the longer strap behind your scrotum and snap closed on top of the penis, forming a ring. The short straps should be hanging down, behind the scrotum. Snap each short strap to the ring, using one hand to hold a testicle and the other to bring the strap between testicles to the side of the ring. Each short strap is intended to hold one testicle.

A variant on this design is the “ball-stretcher” ring, a wider loop of leather or similar material that goes around the scrotal tissue that stretches down when you gently tug the testicles lower. Why use such a ring? Because when ejaculation nears, the testicles rise up closer to the body, and keeping them stretched lower may, for some, delay the time it takes to come, plus some people really like this sensation.





“Gates of Hell”


For those who like these complex cock rings, “gates of heaven” might be a better name. Usually there’s one leather strap/snap cock ring of the kind described above, attached to several other rings. The strap is put on as usual, and the other rings are meant to encage the penis in a series of rings. It looks fantastic, and is a sort of penile bondage; it’s usually seen in the toy bags of BDSM aficionados, and of course a person can use it solo.





Not For Everyone: Cock Ring Safety & Health Instructions


Here’s where we remind you once again that rings are not safe for everyone.

	 Do not use cock rings if you bleed easily or have a blood clotting disorder, if you are diabetic, or if you suffer from any peripheral vascular or nerve disease.

Do not use these toys if you are taking anticoagulants, aspirin, or any other blood-thinning medication.

In the event ring use causes discomfort or any unusual body changes—including bruising, pain, bleeding, or loss of sensation—discontinue use immediately and check with a sex-positive physician.

Do not place over sore, swollen, or infected areas or areas without sensation.

Put a clock within sight and keep cock ring use to around twenty minutes.





Erectile Issues


No drug company will make a lot of money on these “lifestyle” issues, but doctors agree that they would prescribe way fewer blue pills if more men:

	 quit smoking

ate a healthier, lower-fat diet

drank alcohol in moderation, if they do drink

exercised regularly—even just walking





As a matter of fact, these changes would likely improve the sexual experience of women and everybody else, too. They all improve blood flow and/or nerve functioning.





Penis Sleeves


Many users like cock rings a lot, but what if you want a sense of engulfment? For that, you need a different kind of toy, something soft with a supple texture to surround and swallow up the penis. Some want something made of a material that gives the user a similar-to-intercourse feel, thus the street name “pocket pussy.” For all these needs the sleeve was invented—or possibly discovered—half a watermelon, anyone? The sleeve can be simple—a soft-enough-to-grip cylinder is all that’s really needed for this purpose; if it has ripples or little “love fingers” inside to add even more stimulation, so much the better, and some deluxe toys have even more bells and whistles.

What makes these toys more or less expensive is the materials from which they are made or the branding of the product by a porn star. Some companies mold body parts from real porn stars, though the sleeve’s material doesn’t look exactly like flesh, so these are all rather stylized to compensate. They are extremely soft, though, and many love the sensation these sleeves can evoke. There are simple versions of penis sleeves made of elastomer or softskin. You can find versions made of rubber, and as a history lesson, we will tell you that in the old days—the pre-rubber era—they were sometimes made of leather.

The more detailed sleeves feature insertion points designed to resemble vulvas, anuses, or mouths. These are often contained in a canister that resembles a large workman’s flashlight, an extra large soda cup from the convenience store or a can of stackable chips. There’s a simple non-representational “coin slot” version too, just in case you find that more appealing than the look of a body part. The external canister is made of firm plastic and can’t be squeezed against the penis for more intense stimulation, so some users remove the sleeve from the canister altogether and just use the soft cylinder for a gourmet hand job. It resembles a sea creature like a jellyfish when used this way, but the bottom end is open so that the user can play with a vibrator too, if desired, and this feature also makes it easy to clean.

Some manufacturers take the basic idea of a sleeve and jazz it up with vibration or with oscillation. When you choose one of these toys, ask how easy they are to clean; we’ve seen versions where it’s obvious the designer skipped thinking about that part.

We’ll remind you again that many people who think vibrators are for women only find that when their penis feels the buzz, they turn into believers right away!





Pumps


Penis pumps (or vacuum pumps) are toys that provide suction sensations that, while not exactly like oral sex, feel great to many. Though some believe pumps will permanently increase penis size, research has shown that they offer minor effects at best, and over-use can cause injury—so if you are unhappy with your size, a pump is not the way to go. They don’t necessarily create erections for those with erection problems either, though there is a medical version of a vacuum pump your doctor might recommend. We recommend pumps as masturbation enhancers only, not as tools for penis enlargement or treatment of erectile issues. Novelty-quality pumps don’t generally offer really powerful suction, but better-quality pumps are so strong that they can cause small blood vessels in the penis to rupture and should not be used for too long at a time.

The pumps available at Good Vibrations or other adult stores are not medical devices. If you’re going to use one, you’ll need information about health warnings and safe use.





How Pumps Work


Pumps can be used on the nipples, clitoris or penis. A pump creates a vacuum around the body part on which it is placed and draws blood into the area. You may feel heightened sensitivity in this body part when using the pump, and perhaps some decreased sensitivity or tingling afterwards as the body returns to its normal state and the extra blood leaves the area.

The body part will swell as a result of increased blood flow to the area. This size change is temporary; when the pump is removed, the body part will soon return to its pre-pumped state. If you are using the pump on a penis, you may find the resulting erection, if you get one, can be maintained a little longer by wearing a cock ring after the pump is removed. Remove the cock ring after twenty minutes or if use becomes uncomfortable. You may also find that a pumped erection feels a little softer than usual, and remember, if you are unable to get erections at all, a pump is not likely to give you one.





How to Use Pumps


Apply thick lubricant generously around the body part you want to pump; this will act as an air seal to create a vacuum. Applying plenty of lube will also keep your skin moist and prevent it from sticking to the sides of the cylinder as you pump. Please remember that oil or petroleum-based products are not compatible with latex and are difficult to wash out of and off the body; you should wash up after using these if you plan to have intercourse or use any latex products. You may also wish to shave or trim hair around the area to aid in creating a vacuum.

Hold the cylinder against your body so that it encases the nipple, clitoris or penis. Gently squeeze the pump handle or bulb until enough suction is created to hold the cylinder against your body without the support of your hands (this may not be possible with some models). Go slowly; don’t overdo it. Don’t pump for more than fifteen minutes at a time. If you feel any discomfort, discontinue pumping.

Pumping while the pressure is low can result in a sensation that resembles sucking. Adding warmth during pump use—from sunshine, a heating pad, a sauna or hot shower or bath—may increase comfort and the potential for engorgement. Experiment to find the most pleasurable level of pressure and sensation for you.

Have fun and pump safely!

Warning: Do not use pumps if you bleed easily or have a blood clotting disorder, are diabetic, or suffer from any peripheral vascular disease. Do not use pumps if you are taking anticoagulants, aspirin, or any other blood-thinning medication. In the event of discomfort or any unusual body changes with use, including bruising, pain, bleeding, or loss of sensation, discontinue use immediately and check with a sex-positive physician. Do not place over sore, swollen or infected areas, any parts without sensation, above the neck, or on lactating breasts.





Penis Extenders and PPAs (Penile Prosthetic Attachments)


Size is not everything, as we have said many times. That said, sometimes partners decide to add extra length or girth to their penis via a toy; some partners may like playing with an upsized penis from time to time, but don’t just assume that this kind of device will make your sex life with your partner better—ask them if they’d like to explore this. Above all, don’t assume that a larger penis, or penis-plus-toy combo, is the key to a female partner’s ability to orgasm during intercourse. As we’ve already said, this has to do with arousal more than size, and not all women orgasm via vaginal intercourse even when with a well-endowed partner.

If you do want to try an extender, there are several styles. Many don’t fit securely on the penis; the old-style version Good Vibrations sold in the 1980s, the PPA, or “penile prosthetic attachment”—what a sexy moniker, eh?—was held on by an elastic strap. Vixen Creations has recently developed a silicone PPA that has a built-in cock ring, and while one size does not fit all, for those it does fit, it’s probably a far more secure-feeling attachment than those created by stretchy elastic! Lube on the inside of an extender may add to comfort and enjoyment for the wearer; their walls are generally thick or firm, so when wearing one, intercourse will feel quite different and the penis may not feel as much sensation.





Sensual Touch Products & Toys


If sex toys provide a way to enhance erotic experience rather than being seen as just items that substitute for an orifice or appendage, then we could call the sensuality products listed below “sex toys” too, since this category includes anything that enhances skin-to-skin contact. Sensuality enhancers flourish during sexual play. Sensuality is an integral part of sex, just as important and central to the experience as any genital touch or coupling. Let’s remind ourselves of the blissful possibilities of touch and other acts that focus on luxuriating in the senses. Sensuality means many things, but definitely includes touch—relaxing and/or erotic massage, which turns the entire body into one big organ of “feel,” enhancing blood flow and skin sensitivity. You can enjoy sensuality without knowing much about massage, since hand-stroking a body with awareness and focus—not too fast!—feels just as lovely as a massage, especially if those hands belong to your lover. The skin is a sex organ, you know! Zillions of nerve endings are waiting to be awakened.

And that’s just the beginning—this chapter relishes all the many ways of being touched or of filling up the senses—massage is only one of them!

Another reason to take sensual play seriously—it’s among the safest kind of sex that you can have. In the early days of safer sex education, “on me, not in me” was the order of the day. That could mean, “ejaculate on my skin, not in my anus or vagina”—and that’s still good safer sex advice. But it also reminds us that so much erotic possibility lies outside the cavities of the body, and that erotic activity is almost by definition less likely to pass along the STI bugs we want to avoid. For that matter, let us invoke an old-school term, “petting.” This means more than just stroking your lover like you would a sleek cat or dog—the variety of non-intercourse activities this term incorporates were favorites of young people exploring in the back seats of roomy 1950s cars largely because of the centrality of hands to the sexy play and physical exploration that petting entailed. They may have also loved the teasing and proximity to forbidden fruit—without going “all the way”—that such play involved. Travel back in time for a night, using only hands!





Massage Oils


Stroking a dry palm across dry skin is sweet, but just try doing it when it’s slippery—it’s a completely different experience! Massage oils, bars, and soy candles that melt and turn into pre-warmed massage oil are all ways to jazz up the simple act of touching. In choosing massage oil, you’ll find that mostly natural oils are used in their formulation, including sweet almond, coconut, and oils from other nuts and seeds. Most important to your selection is making sure that you don’t have any allergies! Some people are allergic to seeds and/or nuts when eaten, but this reaction doesn’t extend to oils on their skin. Others do react, so please be aware when trying these products.

Also consider scent. Are you scent-sensitive? Do you want essential oils or natural scents, or are you OK with a sweet smell that was cooked up in a lab? Would you prefer an unscented product, or are lovely smells part of what sets a sensual scene for you?

Soy candles are a hot trend. First of all, these are the most amazing-smelling candles; they add flickering light and ambiance to a room and melt at a lower temperature than regular wax candles, one that’s just right for pouring over your skin without pain. Last but not least, the wax turns into massage oil. Even though we’ve told you the secret, don’t worry, it’s still nerve-wracking yet titillating to have someone tease you with the threat of pouring hot candle wax on your body. Fast-forward to the BDSM section if you want to add more to that scene! You don’t need to bring candles and massage oil to the bridal suite when one little candle does it all. PS: Please don’t make the sprinkler system go off in your high-rise hotel room on our account, or if you do, turn it into a wet T-shirt contest and make the best of it!

Massage bars are made with oils that melt at skin temperature; Good Vibrations was the first company to bring these to the adult market and make explicit the connection between sensual touch and many people’s vision of great sex. For the person who loves smelling and handling exquisite hand-made soaps it’s yet another indulgence to fondle the bar! Among other benefits, these products are easier to travel with than liquid oils. We’re living in an era of luxurious, pampering products and emollients with a lavish array of delicious aromas and sensations.

Sensuality exists beyond the hands, and there are more flavors than ever with which to delight and inspire the tongue. If the last time you thought about lickable sexies was when you were faced with a licorice bra at your roommate’s bachelorette party, have we got good news for you! Edible products are finally keeping up with our fantasies. Who doesn’t fantasize licking something off a lover? Lickable body butters, flavored condoms, and edible oils have their own place on the adult store wall—or your bedside table. These can encourage oral play, or enhance the experience by spicing or sweetening up activities you already love. And we don’t mean just fellatio or cunnilingus: a well-schooled tongue can delight almost any body part. Lickability isn’t restricted to clits and penises, vulvas and balls.

Some people will put any tasty morsel into their mouths—others are more restrictive about their diets, both at meals and in bed. So read labels in the sex store as well as when you shop for groceries. Natural or non? Shelf life makes a difference—and the more natural the ingredients in your lickable treat, the sooner it will expire. Also, what do you personally prefer licking or ingesting? If you watch what you eat, you’ll doubtless feel the need to think about ingredients in sensuality products as well. More natural might be the way you choose to go. On the other hand, if you drink soda and eat junk food, you probably think this is way too much ado about nothing.

Caveat: Pouring something sugary and sweet on a woman’s vulva because you’re worried she’ll taste or smell bad is not the best strategy. For that concern, we recommend a warm bath, or even just a shower! The reason is simple: Clean skin tastes and smells better to most people than unwashed bits. Choose lickable products for other reasons—because they sound fun, something new to do, or indeed a way to interest someone in oral sex because it will focus their attention on using their mouth!

Edible dusting powders and body paints, chocolate paint or “pens,” and many other kinds of edible enhancers turn lovemaking into dessert. We don’t promote using flavored products as lubes for vaginal or anal insertion, since the possibility for irritation goes way up when flavored lube comes in contact with mucosal tissue. As for cunnilingus, if you keep your lickable potion on the outside of her body and make your way to her most responsive zones, the yummy flavor can actually teach you a lesson—once you get down there, you find out that you don’t even need to mask the taste! Or use a natural lubricant with natural flavoring. Lickable love products are also used to make condomized fellatio tastier. Any body can light up when being laved by a slippery, smart tongue. And don’t let your diet be an excuse for your reluctance to go down—it’s a low calorie treat!

These fun and elegant oils, bars, gourmet edibles and melting candles are the products of evolution: We started in the Cro-Magnon era of corn-syrupy, jack-off warming gel formulated with glycerine—this is one way warming oils get “warm”: the glycerine magnifies the sensation of friction and hot breath. Now our choices are often eco-friendly and sometimes locally made; they may include a hit of menthol or other botanicals that cause a feeling of heat or icy tingle, and they include less allergy-provoking sensual oils and products like “rub me” bars, “ignite me” candles, the Kama Sutra kits, and more. Tasty fruity products were, in the old days, sometimes anything but fruity or tasty—no real fruit was harmed in the making of this stuff. Choose these products the way you would anything else you plan to consume, and read the labels if you have relevant sensitivities. Some manufacturers have cut way back on artificial colors and flavors, but some haven’t—at Good Vibrations, for example, we know many of our customers care greatly about these issues, though so far, scientific research has not yielded an organic edible panty! But we definitely want you to know you have choices. If you are shopping for twenty-five revelers at a bachelorette party who will hardly remember the favors and you are on a budget, choose whatever grabs the most laughs. If you want to up the ante and give your friends a luxury gift of pleasure, then choose the best quality you can afford for your group. Some will treasure your lavish treat for years to come.





Proper Toy Storage


The three main considerations in terms of toy storage are avoiding extremes of hot and cold—don’t keep them out on the back porch if you live in the North Country or on the equator; avoiding exposure to dirt or pathogens—don’t just toss them under the bed among the dust mites and cat hair; and making sure that the way the toy is stored doesn’t break or damage it, like cramming tender Rabbits into a box with a tangle of cords and harness buckles.

First things first: If you have vibrators or other toys with batteries that you do not use very often, then take the batteries out for storage. Remove the batteries when travelling as well. You don’t want to sit on the tarmac for four hours because your suitcase started vibrating and Homeland Security was called in! There’s at least one documented case of a woman called out of line by airport security—they held up the vibe she’d bought on her honeymoon for all to see. So stash those batteries elsewhere in your luggage and save yourself the aggravation.

Next ask yourself “where?” And “in what?” The tried and true bedroom dresser drawer works well as long as it’s clean and not a meadow for dust bunnies. This is the time to finally put in shelf paper or, if you’re feeling luxurious, a satin scarf as a drawer lining.

Do you own prickly or hard-edged items like the Wartenburg Pinwheel, or restraints with buckles? You will want to separate these from softer materials such as VixSkin™ dildos or any of the softskin variants, which can be more easily damaged than hard material by a nick or poke with a sharp object. Even top-quality silicone will tear readily if its surface is broken through, so definitely don’t keep that dildo where the dog will nab it.

We advise against storing your toys in airtight containers if you live in a climate that is humid or hot. We want toy storage, not a terrarium. Dry and clean are your goals. Leather is particularly sensitive to humidity, and it will not last as long if exposed to moisture.

Premium toys come in opulent packaging that can serve as a lovely storage box forever. And some come with drawstring bags made of beautiful fabrics.

Carol’s favorite place to store toys is in their own antique suitcase. She has one decoupaged, appropriately enough, with pictures of panties! But good-looking chest-style toy storage boxes are sold for just this purpose, and there’s a little suitcase on the market that makes a perfect overnight bag. If you choose one with a velvet lining, be wary of fuzzies sticking to your toys. And if you buy something used, stick your nose in deep to be sure there’s no mildew inside. If it smells musty, don’t store your precious gear in it. That said, you can decorate or create a unique storage case out of a re-purposed make-up or travel bag. These sometimes have compartments or elastics built in to separate one toy from another, which is a good idea.

Some not-so-great ideas? We’ve heard of crafty fairies knitting cock cozies. Now this might be great fun, and good for a dick-art show, but please, check your materials before rubbing them on your toys and your body! For someone who’s allergic to wool, wool fiber on genitalia could be a calamity. If you do get such gifts from an over-enthusiastic aunt or Etsy-trolling boyfriend, rinse your dildos off before use. A lined crocheted bag might be a great improvement: all the cuteness, yet much less risk of little fibers shedding all over your insertable toys.

Wine bottle gift bags are perfect for storing a Magic Wand—they come in beautiful fabrics. Silk or satin bags made to store lingerie are a great way to separate one or two toys from others. This material breathes but doesn’t shed.

Keep a stash of zip-lock bags in or near your toys to keep your lube bottle and massage oils separated from the rest of your gear, especially if you are going to travel out of the house with it. Don’t risk glopping up your lovely little suitcase.

And last but not least, remember electricity. Some of us like to have an extension cord stored with an electric toy so that there’s no crawling under the bed, especially if you are at an unfamiliar house or motel, groping in the dark for a place to plug in. Have you ever dragged a hotel bed closer to the outlet? We sure have, and it’s a good way to hurt your back.





How to Clean Toys


You’ll want to keep your sexy playthings free of germs, which for most items is easy to do; just use mild soap and water. There are other products on the market too, and if you’re the type that finds it awesome to display a bottle of something called “Sex Toy Cleaner” on the bathroom shelf, such products can be found! It’s a cinch to clean your special vibrating friend with a toy wipe—it’s like a human wet wipe, except it’s for your erotic plaything. Since we’re talking about your body and your investment, be sure you buy a reputable brand name and/or from a reputable sex toy store stocking quality items. If you’re not shopping for wipes at a sex toy store, use the kind found in the tissue section of the drugstore or supermarket, not the home cleaning aisle—those have irritating chemicals on them. Even intimate wipes have chemicals—it’s the reason they clean your toy. After each wipe use, go over the toy once with a clean, wrung-out wet washcloth to remove any chemical residue from the wipe, especially if it’s scented. Baby wipes are available everywhere, less expensive and gentle on the skin, though some people don’t like the baby powder smell most of them seem to have.

Wash waterproof vibes and dildos with soap—hand or dish, but not with antibacterial soap containing the cleaning agent triclosan or adult toy cleaner that contains this ingredient. Most toys that are not waterproof can be washed under running water very carefully, making sure you don’t get the battery compartment area wet at all. If that is not possible, use a soapy cloth to wipe it down, then rinse out the soap and wipe again until it’s clean and rinsed free of residue. Getting soap in your vagina and anus isn’t a good idea, nor is it comfortable.

We’ll spell it out again: You really can just use mild soap and water. If you use something with stronger chemicals, you will still need to wash your toy with mild soap and water to remove them, so you may as well just skip that step!

If you feel it’s necessary, silicone dildos, not vibrators, can be boiled for a few minutes to sanitize them, or you can put them on the top rack of the dishwasher—unless it’s Thanksgiving weekend!

Once you’ve used and cleaned your toy, be sure it’s completely dry before storing. This is especially true if you are using an airtight container; it’s not a good idea to rinse off your vibe and then throw it right into a plastic bag, for instance. This not only encourages mold and mildew on some toy and harness materials, but also ruins the mechanism in toys with motors, especially those that use batteries. We suggest air-drying on a clean towel or rack before putting your toys back in storage. You don’t have to store them air-tight, either—some people use fabric, as we mentioned above.

Remember that almost every material will eventually begin to deteriorate, and sooner or later, unless it’s stainless or gold, a toy will suffer some wear and tear. This is most evident in vinyl and latex products. While latex clothes can be supremely sexy to vegans because of their natural, non-animal origin, they live for a decade or two and then melt down. Vinyl materials melt down too, and when they start to go it is a progressive situation. Usually they will exhibit stickiness, then will slump and melt a bit. If your elastomeric (stretchy-squishy) toy starts its final decline, dispose of it properly, then go shop for a new one.





Rabbits, Wands, & Rockets: The Magical Business of Pleasure Products


When and how did human beings evolve from hand jobs or rubbing against a nearby rock to buying or bartering for an object someone else made that delivered a sexual charge? Imagine it as a cartoon episode: a little rock hut with Ogg running happily on a treadmill made of dinosaur skin that powers up a vibrating stone, while Oggalena spreads her legs and has a “rockin” orgasm!

Our close and frisky cousins the Bonobos—a.k.a. pygmy chimpanzees, though they’re actually close relatives, not chimps—have been observed using objects from nature to stimulate their genitals—as sex toys, essentially—which means that if humans enjoy specially-designed gadgets to masturbate with or to incorporate into partner play, we come by this interest naturally. We have a special relationship to tools and technology, and it would be surprising if no one had ever figured out how to make an object to serve as a dildo or a penis sleeve; after all, we have tools to help us do pretty much everything else! Indeed, humans have crafted objects intended as dildos for thousands of years. Carol once saw a terracotta item in the Metropolitan Museum of Art described as a tent peg that she was sure would have broken if someone had attempted to pound it into the Mesopotamian sand; however, using it for erotic purposes would have made a lot of sense. She could be wrong—she’s not an archaeologist, after all—but then again, archaeologists aren’t trained as sexologists, either! Documentation exists of leather and rubber dildos and penis sheaths; the French words for these are telling, and rather charming—consolateur (as in “to console or comfort”) and dame de voyage, the latter term because sailors took their “pocket pussy” toys with them when they went to sea.

Vibrators don’t go back as far—they are, after all, far more reliant on complex technology than dildos—but we’ve heard rumors that Cleopatra enjoyed using a papyrus box full of buzzing bees. Even before electric wall current and the invention of batteries, certain vibrators were people-powered via hand-cranking (like your grandma’s old-school kitchen mixer) or ran by clockwork. Others were steam- or water-powered. The Good Vibrations Antique Vibrator Museum has one vibrator that was powered by compressed air or gas.

Who, you’re no doubt wondering, kept a handy tank of compressed air or a steam generator by the bed? The answer is that these tools weren’t meant for home use, but were professional equipment used by doctors and in health spas. Before many homes even had electricity, the earliest electric vibrators were in use in certain doctor’s offices, primarily those who treated a condition called hysteria (hyster is the Greek root word for uterus). This “disease” afflicted women almost exclusively, and physicians had firmly believed in it since the era of the greatest physician of antiquity, Galen of Pergamon, who described its symptoms and treatment and posited that it arose when a woman’s uterus became unmoored and moved around her body. Well, that would wreak havoc now, wouldn’t it? That is, if it really happened. More likely, the condition Galen called “hysteria” arose from stress, depression, sexual tension or sexual intercourse without orgasm, sometimes with a bit of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety thrown in. We don’t know exactly what hysteria was, because physicians no longer consider it a disease, but for centuries it was treated in the manner Galen recommended: with vulva and clitoral massage to the point of “hysterical paroxysms of relief.”

Well, that’s a pretty schmancy name for an orgasm! Maybe that’s the kind you have on Saturday night, or the ones that really do a good job of relieving stress. In any case, doctors learned to do manual massage of this kind, and while not every woman had access to physicians and specialty treatments like these, doctor-treated hysteria was part and parcel of the medical world for roughly 1750 years. It could take a long time to bring on paroxysm in some women, so midwives or nurses were sometimes recruited and trained to help out. There is little indication that either patients or doctors saw this treatment as a sexual act; after all, “sex” equaled intercourse, and understanding women’s sexuality was hardly a high priority of the healing arts or science until the latter part of the 19th century, if then.

We are talking about the business of sex toys. So who were the salesmen going door-to-door selling hysteria machines to doctors? Who made them?

We’re indebted to the independent historian Rachel Maines for much of the backstory of the vibrator. In her book The Technology of Orgasm: “Hysteria,” the Vibrator, and Women’s Sexual Satisfaction, Maines documents this incredible history: ancient discussions (among men, of course) about women’s health, bodies, and sexuality; hysteria treatments occurring in spas—she includes a great illustration of a woman sitting nude in a chair, a forceful stream of water striking her genitals, and we’re sure fans of hot tub jets and shower massagers will love this visual reference; the earliest inventions that led to the development of vibrators small enough to be sold to consumers as home health aids—sex toys for the frisky ones, who ascertained that the lovely feeling they got from their doctor’s treatments could be replicated at home.

More and more people figured this out as the 20th century moved on, and they learned it from a source that might surprise you: porno movies. When great-great-granddad went down to the fraternal hall to watch him some blue movies—so-called because of the smoky air from the fellows’ cigarettes and big cigars—eventually he might see a movie that explicitly showed a vibrator used for masturbation, or as foreplay. Some of those guys, no doubt, ran home and told great-great-grandma all about it—and within a decade, the era of medical vibrators was on the way out. The cat was out of the bag, and the connection of the “hysterical paroxysm” and orgasm was too evident for business as usual. Within another twenty years, the medical profession literally voted hysteria out of existence; it is no longer thought to be an actual disease.





The Vibrator: Yesterday to Tomorrow


Whether or not they’d gotten the idea that a vibrator was a superior sex toy from a blue movie, Maines notes that prior to 1920 there were more electric vibrators in home use in the US than electric toasters. They were extremely common, as she discovered when researching something else altogether. Looking through turn-of-the-century women’s magazines, she was astonished to see vibrator ads from a number of different companies, including appliance manufacturers whose names are still recognizable, like Hamilton Beach and Sunbeam. Where did people get them? They ordered them in drugstores; from traveling salesmen; and through mail order catalogs sent out by the companies themselves, or from large mail order firms. Though expensive, they were as easy to acquire then as they are today. And for the record, these companies never officially sold or openly deemed them appropriate for sexual pleasure.

These appliances weren’t always thought of as sex toys by consumers—but unlike the “hysteria” days, they sometimes were. Freud had mentioned clitoral orgasm, but he frowned on it as “immature”; many people thought then, as so many still do today, that if it doesn’t involve vaginal penetration, it isn’t really sex, and these handy machines were for external use only. But vibrators were thought to be good treatment for practically anything that ailed you—dandruff or baldness, tennis elbow or hemorrhoids, even tuberculosis! The grain of truth here is that vibrators generate increased blood flow and soothe tired or stressed muscles, which can help with a myriad of conditions—but if you have TB symptoms, please do not rely on your Magic Wand to treat them!



In the 1920s, technological advances enabled companies to make vibrators with lighter materials. During this decade vibrators began to be marketed as much for beauty as for health and wellbeing. The 1930s era of Art Deco inspired beautiful designs and the use of even newer materials like Bakelite and other plastics. Vibrators got smaller. Japan began manufacturing and exporting vibrators as well; resembling little two-toned UFOs, one of the early Japanese vibrators in the Antique Vibrator Museum comes boxed with pictures of baseball players! We wonder if those pictures were a) to represent Health, as in Look, here are healthy ball players or b) as a free gift with purchase or c) hey, want a handsome, muscle-bound man to look at while you use your massager?

During World War II vibrators were rarely made with aluminum, which was needed for the war effort, but in the late 1940s when the war ended this popular material made a comeback. All through the first half of the 20th century, whether advertised or not, vibrators were easy to get, and various manufacturers were looking for creative new ways to design and market vibrating products: Weight-loss vibrators would theoretically shake your excess pounds away—we wouldn’t bet on this being a successful function either; throw pillows for the sofa had secret vibratory powers; Magic Fingers machines in motels cost a quarter to make the whole bed vibrate; and popular vacuum cleaner brand FilterQueen sold a vibrating attachment. None of these items were sold or marketed as sex toys. However, some people knew exactly what they were good for. A scene in The Nun, a notorious stag film made in the late 1940s, showed a woman masturbating with a Swedish massager, the type of vibrator that straps to the back of the hand. After all, it was the era of the Kinsey Report, and not long before the research of Masters and Johnson. More and more people had realized that vibrators were truly useful (wink wink) little gizmos.



In the 1950s, post-war Japanese factories began churning out battery-operated vibrators. Before long they were a consumer product requiring a more effective means of distribution. These vibes didn’t look as sexual as they would a decade or so later, when many were made to look like (relatively) anatomically correct penises—often the early battery vibrators didn’t resemble body parts at all. They were more rocket-shaped, like the later, popular Smoothie design, but they also didn’t look as much like health care-focused appliances as the electric vibrators did; no hair–growing or bad-knee attachment included! Also, they were not necessarily distributed via the same channels. One way they could find their way into the hands of consumers was through a new type of retail establishment, often called an “adult bookstore.” Books were sold there, yes, but so were so-called men’s magazines, sexy movies, and “adult novelties”—including vibrators and dildos.

For at least a decade this was one of the two primary ways that sex toys were supplied to consumers. The other method was via mail order. Just as Rachel Maines found mail-order ads for vibrators in turn-of-the-century ladies’ magazines, as early as the 1960s some battery vibrators were sold via men’s and even some mainstream magazines; the ad would show a contented-looking woman holding a vibe up to her cheek, riffing, in a way, on the old “health, vigor, and beauty” ideas that had been exploited to sell buzzing machines for most of the century. The mail-order vibe ads weren’t quite as sexually explicit as the advertisements in porno magazines, but those vibrators traveled far and wide, as far as the straight magazines that carried the ads. Not everyone would shop at “dirty bookstores,” but many Americans love their mail order catalogs bursting with lovely, handy and helpful items touted to make our lives happier!



Still, this was the era of the term marital aid—an indirect acknowledgment that these items were for sex, but an acknowledgment nonetheless. In the era of Masters and Johnson and the modern marriage manual, this interpretation of a sex toy’s function made a certain degree of sense, but unfortunately it gave a false impression: Vibrators and other erotic products were hardly just for the married, and the word “aid” evokes the idea of a dysfunctional person or relationship. As we now know, enjoyment of a sexual product doesn’t mean you need help!

This criticism of the term “marital aid” is the source of the phrase we still use today, “sex toy”: These two words evoke something else altogether, a sense of play, sensation, and exploration. Enter the late-20th century erotic product: Without this change in descriptive language, we would likely never have progressed to the high-quality toys being made today, with new designers/entrepreneurs entering the industry every year.



For the longest time, however, there were only a few companies that made sex toys, and the main differences in availability had to do with who purchased them and how: gay men in inner-city adult bookstores; husbands picking up something to give their wives, pulling off the Interstate to a little store near a truck stop; people renting a post office box to receive their mail-order goodies. Europe had a woman-founded sex shop long before the US did; Beate Uhse started making sex information and birth control devices available in Germany in the 1950s, and in the 1960s she started a line of stores that bore her own name.

In the 1970s buying toys by mail became more accessible and acceptable as well. The manufacturing companies that had popped up to stock the adult bookstores, like Doc Johnson and TopCo Sales, supplied all of these. Most of those toys were made in the USA and many still are. Imports were available, too. Japan was already making sex toys, as noted earlier, and these entered the market via Vibratex, one of whose owners was a Japanese woman living in the US. They introduced the wildly popular Rabbit Pearl—the vibrator that later had the cameo on Sex and the City. Japanese-made sex toys were high-quality compared to some of the other products on the sex store shelf: Japan used exacting manufacturing standards and had a culture that was light on shame as far as sexual products were concerned. Even so, the little smiley faces on the ends of Japanese vibrators remind us that they were not supposed to look like actual penises—one reason why these items were acceptable in the first place.

Japan was also the source of the single most important vibrator sold in the women-oriented sex shops: the Hitachi Magic Wand. Known as the Original Magic Wand today, the vibrator that American feminists learned to love was just one more good-quality Japanese massager—but its vibration was so steady and appealing that it ultimately built a fan base unlike that of any other vibrator. In the 1970s, women’s pleasure activist Betty Dodson promoted it, and Good Vibrations was founded in part to see that women could access it. It is still one of the best-selling vibrators of all time.

Eve’s Garden opened in New York City in 1974, and Good Vibrations was founded in 1977. By this time the Magic Wand was the vibrator—so highly touted in the women’s community that its reputation spread like wildfire. Some women liked the quieter Wahl Coil better, and some used battery vibes instead of or in addition to one of the electric vibrators. The Wahl Coil doesn’t look much different than the many home massagers featured at The Antique Vibrator Museum—it simply was the one that made it into the 1980s and beyond. Although customers might grouse about how large or loud the Magic Wand was, wishing it were more portable or that it could be used without plugging it in, it steadily accumulated fans who loved its power and its distinct rumbly vibration. All the others had milder vibrations, though that was fine for some—not everyone wants a powerhouse, and the smaller vibes or the more focused head that goes with a coil vibrator can, for some, feel more intense or more pleasurable than the large-headed Magic Wand.



Good Vibrations joined the mail order business in the mid-1980s, for one specific reason: because out-of-town customers begged, demanded and requested we do so! San Franciscans brought out-of-town visitors to our store in the Mission District who, realizing that Good Vibrations was unlike any sort of sex toy shopping environment in their home states, wanted to continue to shop with us. As they left with bag in hand—in those days, they were printed with the phrase “Plain Brown Wrapper”—they inevitably asked the SESA for a catalog to take with them. And so the Good Vibrations mail order business began. Soon the word spread so far that not only had out-of-towners heard about the store, but it had become a San Francisco destination for tourists, right along with the Golden Gate Bridge! Other large catalog businesses during that time were run by The Xandria Collection and Adam & Eve, though neither was female-focused in the way Good Vibrations was. Like Beate Uhse in Germany, the latter business began by selling contraceptive materials like condoms, but its owner soon realized that it would be more successful if it added pleasure products to its line.

Some sex shops were aimed at gay men, others at heterosexuals; eventually the success of Good Vibrations inspired some of the “adult bookstores” to rebrand themselves so as to attract couples and single women, and eventually other sex boutiques were founded that sold, usually, lots of lingerie and a few sex toys. By the mid-1980s, in-home “pleasure parties” were becoming more common; these are especially popular in areas without a sex shop and in more conservative regions of the country where people may be more comfortable gathering in a private home with a few friends than entering a store where they might encounter strangers—or maybe worse, someone they know!

By the mid-1990s, other women-owned sex businesses joined the original two New York and San Francisco flagships. The owners of the first two “second generation” stores, Toys in Babeland in Seattle—later changed to just Babeland, with NYC stores added—and Grand Opening! in the Boston area, interned with Good Vibrations to learn everything they would need know in order to open their own businesses.

Good Vibrations founder Joani Blank had wished that women across the country or even the world would come intern with Good Vibrations, then go home to start stores in their own towns—that’s exactly how she envisioned the women’s sex toy movement would grow: feminist outreach at its core. The next generation of stores didn’t need the hand-holding, though, since by the mid-late 1990s there were four different stores and a growing national sex-positive counterculture; the next entrepreneurs—Madison’s A Woman’s Touch, Toronto’s Come As You Are, Portland’s It’s My Pleasure—had more examples to look to, plus an increasingly accessible sex toy industry. Today it’s more common to see sex toy store owners-to-be at the national trade shows, making contacts on their own.

The 1970s brought us the first independent sex toy creator who developed a highly influential product: the silicone dildo. Gosnell Duncan, founder of Scorpio Products, was familiar with silicone from his earlier working life, but he had become disabled. He realized that the properties of silicone—non-porous, easy to clean, flexible and variably soft or dense—would make it a great material for sex toys, and he created the first as a gift to his wife. Seeing this prototype at a disability conference, other attendees with disabilities clamored for their own, as did some of the therapists in attendance. News of these silicone dildos made their way through this grapevine as well as via ads in independent magazines, specifically On Our Backs, to the women-owned stores where they, and Scorpio’s non-realistic version, rapidly became staples. The next craftsperson to try her hand at silicone dildo-making was the woman who founded Lickerish. Like the Scorpio toys, these looked hand-made: You could practically see the sculptor’s fingerprints on the dildos. Lickerish, a line for women, didn’t bother to make a dildo that looked representational, like a penis; at that time, they didn’t believe that was what their customers desired.

Dills for Does broke the hand-sculpted mold by crafting lovely, carefully-detailed toys; the artist responsible for them was an innovator in many ways. She made smaller dildos than either of the other companies. She assumed her customers would be women, and her only penis-shaped dildo was highly stylized and not very realistic. Others were out-and-out feminist: goddesses and female figures; sly sex toy jokes like a zucchini and an ear of corn; those appealing to nature-lovers, like her whale and dolphin dildos; or wacky, like her dog’s nose dildo and her fishnet-lady’s-leg design. After these brands became wildly popular, an Australian outfit jumped onto the silicone toy bandwagon; a tiny company in Portland developed the world’s first silicone double dildo; and finally, Vixen Creations started up in San Francisco by a former Good Vibrations staff member created what they called “heirloom quality” dildos that even came with a guarantee! At this time Vixen designed prototypes of anything that they themselves or their friends wanted (or had mused over at Good Vibrations) like dildos for packing instead of, or in addition to, fucking, or the glittery dildos requested by femmes. Some styles lasted the test of time and some were one hit wonders, so to speak. Lastly Tantus jumped into the dildo business. Good Vibrations now has its own private label called Pleasure Works.

For many years silicone toys remained a product outside the mainstream of sex toy development. All silicone dildos were made by small independent craftspeople and entrepreneurs; when a brand achieved success, as Scorpio initially did, the owner would have to hire another person or two to keep up with demand. Still, these were available in very few places. In general, the adult bookstores didn’t carry them; they were too expensive and outside the loop of the friends-of-the-store-owner’s network who had originally developed “marital aid” products in the first place. Silicone wasn’t used by the early manufacturers at all. It was a pricey material and hard to work with; any imperfection meant a defective toy that had to be disposed of, since it wasn’t a material that could be re-melted. The big companies mass-produced their toys; they didn’t craft them out back in the workshop. But as far as Good Vibrations customers were concerned, silicone dildos gradually became the product by which other sex toys were measured. We were constantly asked why no vibrators were made of silicone. We were eager to see such a product, but without the ability to make our own toys, we didn’t have much to tell the inquisitive customers other than, “If someone makes it, we will carry it.” If they built it, that is, many more of us would come!

Since the 1980s, the days of the silicone groundbreakers, there have been two sorts of toy companies: those large and mainstream enough to turn out sizable numbers of products in factories, and to work with motors; and businesses creating merchandise that could be crafted in a well-equipped shop in the garage. Even the largest of the leather gear outfits, Stormy Leather, was one of the latter. When they began producing harnesses in the 1980s to strap on those sexy silicone dildos, the BDSM community—and their growing appetite for hot leather toys and creative leather clothing—supported a boom in their business. Stormy Leather was another woman-run company, founded by a British émigrée to San Francisco, Kathy Andrews. For a long time, their leather cock rings were the only items Good Vibrations carried made specifically for the penis. In the 1990s, at long last, our buyers began to give “penis people” some much-needed attention when they selected new toys for the business, carrying more sleeves and other penis-focused items that used to be available primarily on the shelves of the sex stores that catered to men.

As more and more women opened sex toy stores themselves, or had user-friendly stores to shop in, traditional female consumer preferences began to show in the items stocked. Women wanted high-quality items, information about them, and they wanted not only functional choices, but aesthetic variation as well. As sex toys emerged from the shadows they became increasingly visible in the mainstream: shown in pop culture venues such as women’s and men’s magazines—Cosmopolitan alone is responsible for tens of thousands of vibrator sales—mentioned in the burgeoning field of professional sex educator advice columns in newspapers and magazines, and featured on cable TV stations like HBO and Showtime. Vibrator companies grew and created more ingenious and aesthetically interesting designs­­—but nobody could ever guarantee whether a new style would be a success, sexually speaking, or would miss the mark. The designers of sex toys were not necessarily users, so Good Vibrations began passing along as much feedback as possible from customers to companies. Eventually, members of our staff began designing and producing toys.

Other innovative changes were afoot. Erotic movie pioneer Candida Royalle designed a trio of battery-run vibrators that were “ergonomic,” curving to match the shape of the vulva, the better to give extensive external stimulation. As buzz brewed about the G-spot, more toys were designed with a curved head aiming to reach that sometime-elusive vaginal territory. As has always been the case with technological innovation, new tech possibilities made their way to the sex and pleasure department. Smaller toys were powered by watch batteries. Computer chips ended up in vibrators, and now there wasn’t just an on-off switch, but new modes of vibration that included wave patterns and surges. Dildos got more gorgeous than ever; some were made of durable metal and glass.

Sex toys hit the new millennium running. The real moment of change happened early in the ’00s, when European companies jumped into sex toy production. One of the first, Fun Factory, was the innovator we’d been waiting for: the dildo company that finally branched out and made vibrators clad in silicone, not hard plastic or some “mystery rubber” variant.

One of the second wave of San Francisco techies reached out to Good Vibrations to consult on an idea for a toy company that eventually became Jimmyjane, one of the first to go aggressively mainstream, selling products in lingerie shops and exclusive boutiques. Lelo and Je Joue were other Euro-style sex toy companies that made beautiful vibrators, designed with savvy and clad in silicone. Je Joue made a toy with moving part under thin silicone that simulated cunnilingus, its elegant plum-colored skin a far cry from the crude oral sex simulacrum Tongue Vibe of a decade earlier. Though to be honest, our customers were happy to see any toy that sought to make the sexy sensations of oral available! Perfect cunnilingus replication is a bit of a holy grail for the sex toy business.

OhMiBod made vibrators that can be plugged into an MP3 player and will vibrate to the beat of the music being played. The We-Vibe, made by a Canadian company, was an innovative vibrator design that could be used during vaginal intercourse, curving from the clitoris right into the vagina and stimulating both the G-spot and a partner’s penis. Both of these companies subsequently made their toys app-enabled, so couples can use them via wifi and Bluetooth technology even when they’re apart. These latter two companies are also notable because they’re owned by couples, partners who created toys they wanted to use themselves. Jopen vibrators re-imagined the clitoral/vaginal Rabbit style vibe into sinuous, organic curves. Jopen is notable because its innovative CEO, Susan Colvin, was the first woman to lead a large US adult toy distributor—its parent company is California Exotic Novelties—and she went on to mentor women in the industry and place them in decision-making positions.

Tenga initially designed toys just for men and was launched by guys who’d been involved in their country’s techy car industry, creating die-cut soft materials that revolutionized the penis sleeve market. They later began designing their Iroha toy line as well, which is more inclusive of those who use toys for clitoral stimulation. Few companies have entered the market solely with penis toys, which makes this Japanese company doubly innovative.

And it wasn’t just vibrators that innovated. SpareParts Harnesses dumped the leather from the toy box to accommodate those who didn’t want to wear it. They used a stretchy knit fabric designed in a way that gave it strength and control, creating secure and comfortable dildo harnesses.

Perhaps you’ve noticed that we’ve used the word “designed” many times: this is deliberate. A fascinating evolution around the turn of the 21st century brought technological advances and changes in the acceptability of sex toys that not only opened the door to new possibilities, but became the wave of the future. You can still buy the types of sex toys that were available in the 1970s, but beautiful and interesting shapes and materials, not to mention vibrational abilities, have become mainstream, the status quo against which other toys are measured. Now more than ever it’s acceptable to own or shop for pleasure products. You could even say that this industry has gone “out of the toy store, into the streets,” as many items are available far beyond the shops—from adult bookstores to women-run boutiques—that traditionally specialized in selling them. This might never have happened if creative designers hadn’t found the market in need of and worthy of beautification. Think about it: No one in the 1950s woke up and thought “Hey, I am going to make sex toys beautiful and high-functioning, and furthermore I don’t care who knows it!” Now many a designer has yawned, stretched, and thought “I could do better, and I will!”—and subsequently called Good Vibrations to tell us yet another innovative product was coming. Sex toy design and creation has gone from total denial (“health massagers”) to totally public: funding for new inventions is now sometimes crowdsourced! At long last, humans seem to be as matter-of-fact about sex toy use as our frisky bonobo relatives—we can almost hear them asking, “Hey, cousins, what took you so long?”





More Ways to Have Sex

Sex And Water: Bathing, Pools, Intercourse & More


Bath and shower play is another variation on sensuality; it gets the skin shiny and clean for oral play, and offers another kind of full-body focus. It automatically puts some people in the mood, while it’s an unusual new treat for others. Fizzy bath balls, waterproof vibrators and water-resistant lubes, especially silicone, add layers of sensual pleasure to your already-sexy relationship with water, whether you’re bathing solo or with a playmate. In fact, surprising your sweetie with a sensual bath and a buzzy rubber duck might be a fabulous introduction to vibrator play. Do you want to explore a deeper connection with wonderfully sensual H2O? So many learn to orgasm by running water on their clits, and even before they get serious, enjoy the silky slip of warm or cool water across the skin. Try bringing a partner into it, just like letting a partner see your masturbation rituals, and explore how sexy showering and bathing together can be.

We can’t even count how many watery sex scenes Hollywood has pumped out through the years. Think about it: making love in swimming pools, hot tubs, waterfalls, and lakes. The shower scenes alone could fill their own film fest. In Indian cinema, where kissing has been a past taboo, the stars look moony-eyed at each other, followed inevitably by a cutaway to rain or a waterfall—the signal that they kissed.

And what about using the bathroom—the bathing room—as a private safety zone for masturbation? He must be taking a long shower jokes abound. And if you get a group together to share some “jill-off” tips, at least one gal will probably reveal using the water stream or shower head to masturbate.

We’re aware of some young, newly-sexual adults who couldn’t wait to find their own lover to hop into a shower with—only to find it didn’t go quite as smoothly as in the movies. It can be awkward, dangerous or even slapstick-funny. Water streaming down your face, finding it hard to open your eyes and find your liplock target, you end up knocking your nose into your beloved’s chin. And the slipping and sliding—we want romance, not an ambulance! On the other hand, many people are not slippery in the shower exactly where they want to be—making intercourse painful at worst, and just-not-fun at best.

So go ahead and read this chapter for advice on how to dive into water and be almost as glamorous as they are on the big screen.

Pop quiz: What do you need for sex in water?

Answer: More wetness. Yes, more wetness than the H2O itself provides. Intercourse in water can create friction in a bad way, with all that wetness rinsing away natural lubrication. Silicone-based lubricants are the best choice for hot tub lovemaking or getting kinky in the shower. They don’t wash away easily, but stick around to do the trick. If you’re one of those people who can use coconut or another plant-based oil with no problem, these also work better than water-based lubes, which do wash off readily. Careful: Lubes and oils will make the shower floor slippery.





Ahoy, Matey, Starboard side please: Positioning yourself in water


Sitting, swimming, leaning back in hot tubs or baths can be luxurious and relaxing, and depending on your location—tub or pool?—there are easy ways to make watery love.

If you’re in a bathtub, the main issue is enough room; the other challenge might be leverage. For actual intercourse the penetrating partner should be on the bottom; otherwise, there will be knees on the tub floor and your partner’s back possibly banging into porcelain or metal water nozzles—and unless you wear kneepads to bathe in, there’s no way that will be comfortable. Crouching to lower oneself down onto penis or dildo could be the best bet because bathwater creates buoyancy and makes this position easier than it would be on dry land. Splish, splash!

The shower is, theoretically, a perfect zone in which to mingle sex and water, and shower sex is beloved by many. If your shower head has many modes—spray, mist, pulsating—each can give a different sensation. If it’s detachable, so much the better! Running out of hot water could be a buzzkill, and some people don’t have an easy time finding the perfect shower sex position because they can’t stand water splashing in their face. But the biggest challenge is finding leverage to avoid slipping or falling. Having sex while standing up in a shower will make your mother worry! Well, you might not want to tell your mother about this, but we’ll worry. The entire inside of a shower tends to become steamy and slippery, even if you haven’t already soaped up or used an oily or lubricating product—which ups the chances of slippery floors. The towel bar, if there is one, can get pulled right off the wall; ditto with the shower head, which is not designed to be a handle or grab bar. The grab bars installed for safety are probably strong enough—they are supposed to hold a person’s weight, after all. Please be safe if you are having any kind of standing sex, as a fall on hard porcelain or bathroom tiles—to say nothing of glass shower doors—can be really scary.

So what can you do in the shower? Before inviting your sweetie in, scope the place out. Is there a tile or stone wall you can lean against? Leaning on a wall with the water pouring over you while receiving oral sex is a fantasy for many. Be sure the giver isn’t drowning, and remember they might not look up into your eyes if avoiding the falling droplets, but otherwise it could be great fun. Can you come standing up without holding anything? Coming hard and grabbing at weak towel racks to stabilize your undulating body might not go so well. As with every other sex need you can imagine these days, American business can supply products to help you get safely into tub or shower sex. You can buy a footrest and handle with suction cups that keep them stationery on tiles and other smooth, clean surfaces. Because of improved leverage, you get a safer and sexier shower: greater ability to move, plus easier penetration because one leg can be lifted via the footrest. Interestingly, these products were inspired by those access devices for the elderly and disabled, so if you have no way to shop for them at a sexy store, you might still find the suction-attached footrests and handles available at a more mainstream venue.

And remember—even though we usually think of standing in showers, no one says you can’t kneel or sit—make love on the floor and pretend you are in a rainstorm if you want. If you’re already on the floor, there’s nowhere to fall. You can kneel on the floor using a folded towel to save your knees; you can sit in the Yab Yum if the floor of the shower is big enough. Or you can use a shower chair, available in drugstores.





Here, Ducky Ducky!




Never has there been a time when adults have had such a treasure trove of high-quality waterproof toys available for sex play in the bath, shower, hot tub or swimming pool. We already highlighted the vibrating rubber duckies in the toys section; other designer vibrators go from bed to bath and beyonnnndddd. More wet and wild innovations are happening every day, including a fully submersible portable hydro jet that lets you mimic the sexy sensations of hot tub jets in an ordinary tub or pool. These toys come in different sizes and shapes and with suggestions for use, like best for G-spot, clitoral or anal, and they also happen to be waterproof. Find “waterproof” on the box, read instructions carefully before use, then have a free-for-all on land or sea.





In a pool the standing positions work well; doggie-style in the shallow end, with the insertee leaning over the edge of the poolside, is definitely hot if there’s a pool float nearby to cushion the body. Clawing at the concrete around the pool might sound hot in a porny kind of way, but in real life it’ll probably be uncomfortable. Use that raft to good advantage. Use those big silver ladders and rails as leverage—you get the “sex in deep water” thrill without the danger. We don’t know anyone who can float and fuck, so do not venture into the middle waters—but perhaps some professional swimmers have managed this feat. As for the rest of us: Please stay at the shallow end for your amorous adventures.

Some like soaking in a hot tub with an amore until they’re both relaxed, then one partner sits up on the edge while the other bestows some lavishing licks. Or talk about a sexy midnight swim—sneakily pulling a bathing suit over to the side so you can get access to your honey’s pleasure parts can be naughty fun. For intercourse in a hot tub there’s usually a bench or step on which the penetrating partner can sit; it’s easy for the other person to sit in their lap facing them or facing out to make it a seated doggie style session. Standing rear entry works, too, or standing face to face might be possible depending on your height.

We’re talking mainly about intercourse positions here, but water-world may not be the place you choose to do that; maybe you’ll just get hot and wet in the shower or pool and then move out of the water to get it on. Perfectly great plan, because if you are going to do penetration in the water, you’ll be getting the contents of the water inside the vagina or anus—maybe not a lot, but if it’s chlorinated, or bacteria-laden, it can cause problems. Speaking of bacteria, please remember that intercourse in the water also means you leave some of yourself and your partner behind… Do not ejaculate or leave other body fluids in someone else’s pool. Not good sex etiquette!

Surprising your sweetie with a sensual bath and a buzzy rubber duck could be a fabulous introduction to vibrators.



A sexy, healthy compromise is to stick to oral sex and “outercourse” in the water. In fact the bath or shower is the perfect place for oral sex, and many a lover has done their “going down” for the first time while in a watery place. Their lover has just showered, so for those worried about the smell of the locker room, or who’ve heard scary rumors about vaginal scent, it’s the perfect time to try it. And many others have oral sex in the shower or tub because they don’t in fact like the smell of the day’s sweat in their face—it’s the perfect way to get clean and get off.





Sex & Food


Any book focused on pleasure wouldn’t be complete without including the many intersections of sex and food. From sensuous eating to using edibles as your sex toy, food and sex are two great tastes that taste great together. Erotic possibilities abound, and this is a kind of mildly kinky play that even vanilla people can love. Focusing on the sexy side of food gives you many new ways to flirt, initiate, and sweeten up your foreplay.

Chocolate has long been a sexy tradition—now there are even product commercials that show women rolling around in satin, devouring chocolate. And it’s a super-sexy food for a reason: It’s full of feel-good chemicals, including PEA (phenylethylamine), which is thought to promote feelings of love and euphoria.

But cacao isn’t the only foodstuff getting the sexy advertising treatment. We’ve seen ads selling burgers with some pretty suggestive innuendo: “If it doesn’t get all over the place, it doesn’t belong in your face,” complete with the image of burger juice and red ketchup running down the chin, getting swiped by fingers and dripped conveniently on body parts. Tasty! (Unless you’re vegan.)

Throughout the ages, way before little blue pills or vibrators were invented, the human race looked to certain foods as aphrodisiacs. Even today some recipes have “Better Than Sex” in their names, but do they lead to sex? Do aphrodisiacs really work to bring out your inner wild animal or sex machine? Maybe not exactly—in fact, many scientists say “Not at all”—but if feeding someone or getting your body licked while you indulge in a vanilla ice cream cone turns you on and drives you wild, then perhaps it works for you.

If you didn’t get that ice cream reference, check this out: Big Bitch is a comic character, featured in her own books by the late Spain Rodriguez. After her spy adventures she relaxes by leaning back in a chair while her “faithful manservant” Asquieth gives her oral pleasure as she eats vanilla ice cream.



Some cultures’ food items that are purported to make a man virile would make most American’s stomachs turn—they include blood, the penis and even the semen of certain animals. If they don’t make you gag, they might make your conscience hurt, because often these are organs from endangered species. In American culture we often want to do something that works right now, and in that way, aphrodisiacs definitely don’t work—they don’t create instant and insatiable turn-on, as many aphrodisiac seekers hope they will. But over time, eating nutritiously and exercising so that you have good circulation can improve your health and sexual functioning, so in that big-picture way, food may work as an aphrodisiac after all. But if you’re looking for a quick aphrodisiac from your eats, no less an adventurous gourmand than Anthony Bourdain says this doesn’t exist. He’s been offered many foods with claims to increase virility. “Like you’re supposed to [eat this] then go home and impregnate whoever falls into your path. But it’s all a myth,” he said in a 2011 Playboy interview.





Playing with Your Food


What kind of food is sexy to you? Does it have to do with taste, texture, or what it looks like when you watch someone eat it? Classic aphrodisiac foods often looked something like genital organs, and many a horny grocery shopper has gazed longingly at the produce. Here are some basic categories of food sex.

Sharing: Feeding each other by hand can be sweet and erotic, and it can have kinky dominance and submission overtones too. But if you want to up the ante, feed your lover food or drink from your mouth rather than just using your hands.

Slip-sliding and rubbing: Many foods, especially fruits, are slick and feel erotic sliding on skin or rubbed onto sensitive places.

Licking: You can follow up with a tongue bath after you trail a piece of mango or some other luscious fruit over the skin, or you can drip tasty substances and lick them up.

Fucking: People with penises don’t have to abuse the liver in the fridge, like Portnoy of Portnoy’s Complaint (1969), or molest an apple pie like the famous scene in the cult film American Pie (1999). They can go for a melon instead. And people with vaginas may choose a zucchini instead of a dildo.

A taste of kink: Hot and spicy foodstuffs bring the burn—negotiate where you’re going to drizzle the hot pepper sauce!





Getting Prepared—Your Sexy Shopping List


Finger foods or foods that can easily be sliced with a fork (like cake) and that aren’t too messy or crumbly are the best for feeding one another, as is fresh fruit like strawberries and bananas. Consider buying warm or cold foods, too, like “molten” cakes or popsicles. But be very careful about how hot the food is inside—remember that sometimes the surface will cool down more rapidly, so don’t burn your partner. Many 9 ½ Weeks fans remember the scene featuring strawberries in chocolate. Actually, in that movie, the whole fridge was fair game. It and Tom Jones might be the all-time food fetish movies.

For savory foods, just think of your lover’s favorite flavors. Oysters, shrimp, salty French fries, Brie or other fancy cheeses, fresh tomato and basil can all be delectable choices. In Flashdance it was fresh lobster dripping with butter.

If you’ve ever seen the Ohio Players’ sexy album cover you probably have a special taste for the look of a lovely body dripping with honey, but sadly, gooey honey is a little too overwhelming for most food sex—it won’t let you move on to other activities when you’re ready because it’s such a project to lick, or wash, it all off. But syrup does many of the same sexy, tasty things and is more manageable. Sauces like ice cream toppings are already liquid without needing too much heating; they include butterscotch and caramel, among other luscious flavors. Drizzling, not pouring, is best because it’s not too much for you to lick up. Most people don’t enjoy drowning in syrup but like a little line of it lapped off whatever sexy body part you put it on.

Chocolate fountains can be bought at most department stores, and can even be rented if you’re planning a one-off chocolate orgy. Suaveness Tip: For the chocolate fountain to work properly, it needs some prep time; read the instructions carefully. Don’t buy one, then open it five minutes before your date begins and expect to look like a sophisticated chocolatier.

For those favoring savory foods, consider a nice olive oil—maybe a flavored one. Mmmm, and good for your skin.

To whip or not to whip? That is the question. Cream, we mean—what did you think we were talking about? In Varsity Blues Darcy wears a whipped cream “bikini”—and are you old enough to remember the Herb Alpert album cover featuring a woman dressed in whipped cream? On the other hand, dairy can get sour…it’s your call, but if you have a tub or shower nearby, whipped cream is a food sex classic.

Delicious drinks—champagne, blood orange soda, fresh lemonade all work for keeping your mouth wet. Take a sip, then pass it to your lover in a kiss. Red wine has been an elixir of love for the ages, but if you or your sweetie is sober you may want to consider other warm or cold options that delight the senses. Mocktails, especially of the tropical persuasion, can be an excellent turn-on.

Pick up some unscented baby wipes or intimate wipes that are natural and chemical-free. They’re great to have handy for cleaning up. If you don’t have any, bring a wrung-out washcloth and keep it in a bowl by your bed or wherever you’re playing, so you can wipe up any of the juices, sauces or crumbs that you didn’t already slurp up.

And if you think candy is dandy, you should know that an enterprising purveyor of sweets makes them into bikinis, thongs and cock rings. Start nibbling, and soon your sweetie is nude.





Setting Your Scene


Towels: Depending on how messy you plan to be—for some people, getting sticky and splooshy is part of the fun—you might want towels handy or already laid out, covering your sheets or upholstery before you begin. If you want to make love on the kitchen floor then take that into consideration so you don’t leave your lover mid-strawberry while you run for a cushy sleeping bag! Beyoncé may be “drunk in love” and can’t remember how she ended up on the kitchen floor, but let’s assume she has someone else cleaning up after her.

You can have sex in the dark, but when you’re using food, it’s nice to see your lover’s body so you can aim your peeled grape or whipped cream canister at the parts you want to tantalize or lick. Candlelight is always sexy; if you’re in a no-fire zone then use a dimmer switch or some kind of ambient lighting. Holiday lights work too—they’re twinkly and festive.

Be prepared with your foods of choice presented on trays, cut up and ready to use. Unless you really want to recreate that kinky 9 ½ Weeks fridge scene, that is.





Tasty Ideas to Try


Try feeding your loved one bites of their favorite food while blindfolded. Clean up their lips with licks, kisses and nibbles from yours.

Straddle your partner while they sit in a chair and feed them.

Back to those mocktails: Try pulling out a piece of fruit from your virgin Sangria and tracing it along their lips or nipples.

Popsicles can be quite fun. You can run one along your partner’s body in almost any area: along the foot, up the thigh, across the nipples, belly, neck, on their lips. It will leave a sweet, sticky trail for you to lap off their skin. If either of you likes giving head, you can tease each other by showing how you would do that (on the popsicle) or showing what you would like to be done to you.

Cherry nibbling contest: Some people think of tying a cherry stem into a knot using only their teeth and tongue as a way to show their oral prowess. We have an alternative game to suggest: Try holding up a cherry by its stem while your partner nibbles the cherry off. Make them show how delicate and precise their tongue and nibbles can be.

You Take the Cream game: Here’s another one to show off tongue skill. Pick a pastry that has cream in the middle and dip the tip of your tongue down into it—in between two layers of pastry or into an éclair—while looking up into your partner’s eyes.

Feet are particularly fun helpers when it comes to food and sex. You can sit on the floor and lick your love’s feet, or rub them while they enjoy their food of choice. Foods and drinks can be slurped up off the foot.

Make up rules for a sexy game—they only get a bite if they _____. You fill in the blank; they’re your rules. OR they don’t get a bite if they are naughty. Be a food dom!

Use your partner’s belly or thigh or chest…or? Or?…as a serving platter, arrange edibles and then dine. For an erotic Caprese salad you will need to drizzle olive oil—drizzling is almost always a good idea. Or lay out a sushi dinner! At some sexy San Francisco parties, this is a group activity.

The back of the body can be just as delicious as the front. Drizzling, trailing, tracing droplets of tasty treats right along the back of your partner’s neck, down the shoulders, past the small of their back to the ass—or up from the bottoms of the feet and back of the knees to the inner thighs…Ooh la la!





Food Kinks


Food doesn’t have to be vanilla-flavored, literally or figuratively. We already mentioned those hot, hot sauces. Have you heard of figging? It matches an intense food—ginger—with a sensitive body part—the anus. Using raw ginger root, not prepared ginger, as a butt plug results in very intense sensations. We wouldn’t recommend this; the anus is an extremely sensitive part of the body. But some people do it.

Sploshing is another food kink—it refers to messy play. If your idea of food fun isn’t genteel strawberry-nibbling, but rather dumping a can of cooked cherries onto your lover then smooshing your bodies together with glee, this might be the kind of kinkster you are. Two words: Rubber sheets! Or get a kiddie pool and sploosh around in there. If you don’t take our word for this, after you come, you’ll wish you had the phone number of Beyoncé’s housecleaner.





What to Watch Out For


You may be a sexually savvy foodie, but don’t forget about the dangers and problems that can come with this kind of play. Be aware of allergies, dietary restrictions, and diagnoses of diabetes or any other health issue that could be linked to or triggered by certain kinds of food. This warning is quite serious. Do not blindfold someone or give them a type of food in the dark that you are not 100% positive they can safely eat. Ask about food issues in your pre-play communication and negotiation.

Unless your partner definitely knows otherwise, assume that if they can’t eat a food, it shouldn’t contact their genital mucosa either.

Don’t get sugary foods into the vagina or in the tip of the penis. Perhaps you weren’t planning to insert chocolate sauce into orifices, but if you don’t shower off after sploshing, the stuff might get in there anyhow. If you were planning to use that popsicle as a dildo, put a condom on it.

When you’re engaged in sensuous feeding, beware of anything that might be a choking hazard or, as your grandmother used to say, “go down the wrong pipe.”

We’ve mentioned using hot, spicy foodstuffs to generate intense sensation and heat, but be aware that some people can react to this kind of play with skin irritations. Also, you can’t wash off peppery substances immediately, especially if they’re oil-based: this means you also can’t turn off the sensation, no matter how painful or un-erotic it may have become. Have a plan in place in case your partner needs the substance off immediately. It may help to have alcohol-based wipes on hand; this can cut oil-based products more quickly than plain water. Test a tiny bit on a sensitive area before you start your hot sauce blowjob.

When using a vegetable or fruit as a dildo, beware of any sources of irritation—wash the pesticides off as thoroughly as you would before putting it in a salad. Sometimes it’s best to peel such an item before use, unless the peel, as in the case of a banana, is part of its structure. The most common risk in using a veggie sex toy is losing it or having it breaking off inside your anus or vagina. When this happens while figging, you can see it’d get to be overwhelming very quickly.

Speaking of anal food adventures, perhaps you have heard of people taking coffee or wine enemas. This is a risk-filled practice because the anal mucosa is so absorptive that the chemicals—caffeine or alcohol—reach the bloodstream very quickly and consuming them this way bypasses the protective step of being metabolized by the liver. Danger!





Finally…


Why not combine epicurean food play with the wet fun outlined in our chapter on water? Our last tip is to make sure the bathtub is clean, with fluffy towels folded and bath salts ready so that after all the food fun you can de-sticky-fy yourselves by sinking down into a warm, relaxing bath.





Hot Talk & Role Play


Do you want to have sex with lots of people? Or as lots of people? And maybe even as different creatures? You don’t have to be polyamorous or a shapeshifter in order to have consensual, fabulous sex with many different people in many different ways and in many different bodies. What’s the secret key to this land of freedom and decadence? Fantasy, hot talk and role-play. By incorporating these into your sex life, you can have the variety many people crave.

A disclaimer to some married folks—not all fit this bill, by any means, but to some, and you know who you are: We brought up polyamory because, despite our how-to’s on the subject, let’s face it: Oftentimes the hunky co-worker or gorgeous babe-across-the-bar you long for is much hotter in your head than in your real-life bed. Many a relationship has been brought down by an imagination gone wild and gone wrong. And to top it off, this gorgeous creature you threw away your relationship for ended up disappointing in one way or another—all that pain and misery wasn’t even worth it. So that’s why we offer this alternative, that hopefully will only invigorate your existing partnership.





Role-playing


Cosplay, anyone?

Did you always want to get busy with an office secretary? The President of the United States? The President of a distant planet in Star Wars? Dressing up and playing a role can make sex a whole new experience, hotter than you ever imagined and more fun than you’ve had since you were a kid trick-or-treating on Halloween. You might think you look silly, but with a little open-mindedness and a playful attitude you can be transported into any time and space you fantasize. Some people go all out and spend money on costumes and gear. If you know you are going to love an outfit and use it in fantasy play often (or wear it again next Halloween, Carnival or ComicCon) then it makes sense to spend money on the whole shebang, from head to toe—and don’t forget the shoes. If you’re not sure how much you really want to play this character, then it might be prudent to keep your money in your pocket and try it out first with a homemade costume, or just verbally.

A lot of people love costume play, or “cosplay,” as an erotic variant because it lets them explore new personas. Dressing up for a role you want to play can make it easier to fantasize and get into character, plus garments can be sexy, fetishistic, and good old-fashioned hot and dirty fun.

Many towns have costume stores or places that sell vintage clothing that are full of options for dressing up erotic characters you might want to develop, not just on Halloween. Speaking of which, hit those Halloween pop-up superstores on November 1st to stock your dress-up closet for half the price. Maybe your own closet already has items that you can put together to craft a “new you.” Your outfit doesn’t have to be fancy, at least for starters. Leggings with an oversized shirt belted at the waist transforms you into a pirate. You’re play-acting, after all. Improvise. If you find characters to play that need fancier outfits, when you’re into dress-up and cosplay, shopping is half the fun.

Try saying what your character might say and keep a few props nearby—a secretary could have a pad of paper and lecture/tease/plead with the “boss” that they are not supposed to “just get you coffee! I have important work to do!” The big pop star might be talking about their latest song or need to involve you in rehearsal for their music video. If you want to be a werewolf, go to a party store and buy just the gloves—yes, they sell just the furry mitts, so you don’t have to don an entire hot, furry, rubbery costume.

As discussed in our BDSM section, choose a safeword when you talk beforehand about issues such as the use of contradictory or challenging language in role-play. For example, if a space trooper is going to pick up a Princess from a far away galaxy and carry her fighting all the way to the ship, yelling “Help!”—set up those details ahead of time. Discuss which part turns you on: the yelling? Fighting off an enemy? Being overtaken by an enemy? And we mean either way! Does Space Princess overtake him and make this her scene? Do you want to just act out these characters as they have sex, with no fighting at all? Or are you saying “Hey, no, no, that’s not the point, just get to the ship and it turns out to be our renegade Hero disguised as a space trooper”—you see how complicated fantasy and role play can get? For some people, this world of possibility is the heart of playing with roles—we’re stepping out of our ordinary persona and anything can happen.

We suggest:

	 Do choose a character that excites you and/or your partner if you have one.

If you are single and doing online dating profiles, don’t be afraid to put your interests in your profile so you can find like-minded people. These interests could be worded in a general way or in a sexual context—however you like and/or feel safe putting your interests out there.

Don’t choose your spouse’s best friend or any real person that is close to both of you to use as fantasy fodder. Chances are it’ll bite you in the butt later on—maybe even tonight, before either of you has a chance to have an orgasm.

Don’t shame your partner or yourself if things don’t go as planned.

Do laugh and have fun even if it ends up not rocking your sex world. Role-play is theatrical and experimental—it’s meant to be a temporary state, and you can always try it again later.

If you are going to use characters that might be confusing, discuss before you are in character what your verbal or body language will mean. What does the fox say? What will the Wookie’s love roar sound like?

Do be clear about what part turns you on if you know. If you don’t know, say that too! It will help ensure that element of excitement gets worked into the fun.

For people who like viewing adult erotica, there are countless porn parodies on the market, so you can find your favorite TV or movie character in a sexy scenario that might just fulfill—or spark—those fantasies.





Hot Talk


Making sounds during lovemaking and masturbation can crank up your arousal level as well as enhance orgasm and the feelings of afterglow. If you are alone masturbating, then you don’t need to worry about negotiating or explaining yourself to anyone. You can try moaning aloud, saying “naughty” phrases to yourself, or using words to live out a fantasy that you are thinking about while you touch yourself.

Seems like most people have a strong opinion about how loud and wordy they do or don’t want their pillow talk to be. Some people don’t like dirty talk or noisy sex. For some it brings up shame or confusion around sex, so all, or just certain kinds of, sex talk prevents them from blissing out on their bodies; it keeps them in their heads and focused on whatever issues might come up. They can’t relax if they are thinking about the neighbors, the church they grew up in, or conversations in their head from past relationships or experiences.

People who have no shame about sex might dislike talking for other reasons. Some find it distracts them from their bodily sensations; they’re going for a body high and “getting lost in the moment,” but their partner’s voice pulls them out of that altered state. Others might love the right kind of talk but are so particular that if their partner says what to them is the wrong thing, it ruins the fantasy in their head, confuses them, or involves words that are a turn-off instead of a turn-on.

On the other hand, many people love sexy sounds and hot talk during sex. Moaning and breathing and saying “Oh yes!” are classic ways to let the good sensations flowing inside you shine through to the outside. Not only can these sexy sounds let your lover know they are pleasing you, but as our friends the Tantra practitioners might tell us, opening up your lungs can enhance your feelings as well, whether you do it via deep breathing or sound-making. When it comes to classic dirty talk, many charged words make us feel naughty or kick-ass by simply saying them. Exhibitionism for the Shy by our own Dr. Carol Queen has pages of examples.

Then there is Dirty Talk 201, which is specific to your (or your partner’s) particular fantasies or turn-ons. This involves going deeper into characters and scenarios, and it’s where you need to speak up if you don’t like something—otherwise you can suddenly feel like you’re in bed with a stranger! On the other hand, you need to have a thick skin and not feel criticized or defensive if your partner tells you they don’t like something you say. If you’re neutral about a fantasy’s language—as in, it doesn’t turn you on yet it doesn’t turn you off—but it super-turns on your lover, then consider going along with it. On the other hand, if something makes you stop, or you don’t like it, you need to say so. Their fantasy does not trump your good time. Later, when it isn’t a charged sexual situation, you might choose to examine what about that scenario didn’t feel good to you. Look at it as one more way to learn useful detail about your own sexual responses, wants, and limits.

Here’s an example: If you are more of a “top” personality—the bossy or take-charge type—you might not like someone to say while penetrating you, “You’re so cock-hungry, begging for me to fuck you!” In your head you might be thinking instead, “You are dying for this pussy. You are a slave to my pussy and you only live to fuck me.” Hmmm. In that case, as long as you both love the sex, you might decide to actually not say what you are thinking out loud. Or use each one’s favorite role at different times: “When I’m coming, preach your devotion, and when you’re coming, I’ll be your love slave!”

Hot-button pet names can really rev things up quickly too, and some people love endearments that to others might sound shocking.





Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be


You might be thinking, “All this sounds great, Professor, but how do I start?” Maybe you’re usually shy and apt to get choked up in the moment. At other times you might feel like you can roll around and release those sounds into the air. Still other times, if you barely even moan aloud you think it echoes across the land. No matter what the issue is, with a little time and practice you can achieve whatever level of erotic demonstration you yearn for, from releasing naturally noisy breathing and moaning, right on up to a red-hot diatribe of nasty words unleashed on an adoring lover.

Identify the language or scenarios that make you hot. Add them to your experience of masturbation. Talk out loud—don’t worry, you’re alone.

In partner sex, start simple: Oh yes, Oh please, Fuck me, I’ve gotta fuck you—and if you want to add any complexity, simply narrate what’s going on at that moment. You’re running your hands over my thighs, it feels so good… Bonus points if you follow up with Oh, please put your hands on my…you decide what to say and what to call it.

Share erotic stories or movies with your partner and identify which scenarios and language make you both hot.

Narrate your favorite fantasies together next time you have sex. Notice which parts are most successful for both of you, and which get you most turned on.

It might be easier to tell a story than to be a character in the story… so try it both ways and see if you like one version better than the other.

Choose roles to play that have a sort of built-in script: A traffic cop saying, “Now, sir, I’ll need you to put those hands on top of the car—don’t move” is just one of countless examples.

Do you have a favorite movie or book with erotic undertones? Pretend to be those characters. Play out a scene from the movie. Or make up your own.

Pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. Later on, as your role-play progresses, you can actually arrange to meet at a bar, bookstore, or hotel lobby and play out the scene, culminating with the “pickup” when you take your perfect stranger “home” with you.

You can have sex in silence all your life, with no soundtrack but the sweet sound of each other’s breathing in your ears. You can make love as yourself, only yourself. But you can also choose to use sound and fantasy characters to take an erotic trip and experience worlds of variety and sexual adventure, even if you are death-do-you-part monogamous and never leave home. Role play lets you live many lives.





BDSM and Other Kinks


What is BDSM?

Bondage & Discipline, Sadism & Masochism. The D and S also stand for Dominance/Submission—the latter is for people who like to role play but might not eroticize pain. The whole question of pain is confusing, because many SM aficionados don’t think what they do feels painful. It might be more appropriate to call it “intense sensation.” We have always loved pioneer BDSM activist Cynthia Slater’s definition: What these types of play have in common is that they all involve consensual, eroticized exchange of power.

We think the reason for people’s strong response to kink—whether in literature and fantasy, or real-life erotic play—is simple: BDSM desires are part of human sexuality. Even—or maybe especially—in rather conservative eras, the idea that sexual desire can be aroused and contextualized by a powerful and compelling lover can hold strong erotic appeal. The “dominant Master” trope can attract those who love the sexual power of the he-man, though of course we must never forget that many people are equally or more greatly inspired by the thought of a dominant Mistress. Plus, more than many other kinds of sex play, kink can be divorced from any possibility of reproduction, and that means you really are doing it just for the passion, intensity, and pleasure involved. This helps explain, too, why some people might find the idea of kink so erotic and fascinating when they stumble across it in a book or movie, but wind up not finding its physical expression as hot and pleasing as it was in their imaginations. The notion that sex can be whole-bodied, replete with mind-blowing and boundary-busting sensation you can’t ignore, that it can flirt with or embrace virtually any taboo: these can be compelling elements of fantasy, and some people definitely find they love to act them out. If you think you might be one of them, read on.





50 Shades of Kinky Culture


As we write this book, we’re in the midst of pop culture’s fascination with Fifty Shades of Grey. The Fifty Shades series was a huge success, but whether or not you’re a fan, remember that this sex style is nothing new. Every generation or so, a new SM blockbuster hits; some don’t make it into the mainstream or Target like Fifty Shades did, but every few years some book, movie or music comes out and generates a gossip-fest, inspiring intrigue with kink that spreads like wildfire throughout mainstream culture. This interest—and the erotica catering to it—has a history.

The Story of O was perhaps the first of the blockbuster-level books, though Victorian erotica is full of kink as well. While Emma Peel’s sexy catsuit had great pop-culture appeal in the 1960s, private and secretive BDSM clubs were beginning to form using code words from Story of O to lure those in the know via classified ads. 9 1/2 Weeks (the book and subsequent movie) was a giant hit in the 1980s, and Anne Rice—using her Anne Roquelaure and Anne Rampling pseudonyms—didn’t exactly fly under the radar, especially with her book Exit to Eden. Skip the movie; the book is way kinkier, and the Roquelaure Beauty series sizzles. Madonna flirted with BDSM in her book Sex and especially in the movie Body of Evidence. And what about those lyrics to “Hanky Panky”—was Madonna a sex renegade, as lauded in that era’s press? Maybe, but songs about kink were certainly written and sung before 1990. Listen to the songs of Bessie Smith from the 1920s; or even some Cole Porter songs. Or what about the words of Lou Reed’s 1967 tune “Venus in Furs”? You might picture a voluptuous woman wearing a fur coat. But if you were aware of BDSM it would remind you of a much earlier piece of work, a novella published in 1870 by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, from whose name the term masochism—the “M” in BDSM—derives, just as the “S” originated with the Marquis de Sade.

The point is, every generation has its own kink-centric “Oooh! Did you hear about…? Oh my!”… cultural experience. These BDSM hits draw out the curious and inspire nice girls and respectable boys to go wild, because they light the fire down below. Once they try it they might stay with sex on the fringe, or they might decide BDSM isn’t for them. It often happens that simply reading about or seeing kink can turn a person on, but then they find they don’t actually like doing the acts they read about. Instead of saying, “Oh, I didn’t like that,” it’s perfectly okay to acknowledge that you did get aroused by the entertainment, and now you want to have sex like you always do. There’s no rule that says you have to experience every single act the idea of which turns you on.

Most mainstream culture hits are kinky but fairly heterosexual, since queer literature and movies have not been considered at all mainstream until relatively recently. But there’s nothing vanilla-only about the offerings at the LGBTQQ bookstore. Gay men have a long history of enjoying BDSM erotica as well—perhaps the best-known of these books is John Preston’s notorious Mr. Benson. Many people of all sexual orientations have learned sexy tricks from gay men, who had a well-developed BDSM subculture in the US well before most heterosexuals had access to their own clubs for kinky exploration. As for bisexual or lesbian women, plenty of them have been having a blast tied up, hanging from ceilings, spanking to their hearts’ desire, fisting in slings with nipple clamps on—whether anyone noticed it or not. To get an idea of this fiery sex play, there is no finer piece of writing than Pat Califia’s classic Macho Sluts.

For some people kink is a huge part of, or even their entire repertoire of, sexuality. For others it is on the menu but not an everyday selection. So for those who try a little kink, have their mind blown and a passionately want more: Lucky for you, there’s a whole world of communities, magazines, and erotic and how-to books, audio books, and videos to discover.





Negotiation & Scenes


People who engage in BDSM engage in various kinds of activities, and not everybody who’s “into BDSM” wants to do all of them; some people have a strong preference for something specific, and may even identify around whether they will be a top or bottom—that is, the do-er or the do-ee. How do they figure out what they want to do? After all, new partners who don’t do any of that kinky, complicated stuff sometimes find their desires don’t line up exactly right.

The answer is: They negotiate. If you are thinking of a boring business contract—this is a pleasure contract, in a way. And even if you are 100% vanilla and never want to do any kinky play, learning about negotiation might make your sex life better. So stick around.

We’ve already introduced the Three Lists exercise, and we hope you’ve done it to clarify for yourself your sexual likes, contingent maybes, definite boundaries, and curiosities. These are all extremely important for you to know, and to take responsibility for, when you negotiate. Let’s say you meet a person who tells you they’re into BDSM and you find them attractive; you’re intrigued. Maybe you already know you’re into that too, or maybe you’re just curious and open. But are you compatible? The information from the list exercise lets you find out. “Do you like this, this, and this?” you ask them, or they ask you. “I love the first two, but I don’t know about that last thing,” might be the reply. Or “I haven’t tried any of that before, but I’m really curious about that one thing; I’d try it for sure.”





Vanilla Sex Defined


“Vanilla sex” is a phrase popularized by people who identify with the kink community. It basically means “non-kinky sex”: kissing, touching, oral, intercourse, and all that lovely stuff, without bondage or spanking or all that lovely stuff. So a person with no interest in anything BDSM-related might be termed “vanilla.” Think of this term as you see it on the wall at the ice cream shop—every ice cream shop has vanilla, right? But it will carry many other fancy flavors besides. Sometimes people want a cone that’s all loaded up with other tasty stuff—and so it is with erotic play. Maybe you’re mostly vanilla but occasionally engage in some sprinkles on top. “Vanilla” is not a term that means any disrespect to old-school sex, so don’t use it that way and don’t let anyone tell you you’re “just vanilla.” Vanilla is delicious all by itself.





You don’t need to know for certain whether you like something to try it out; everybody has a first time, right? You do need to be honest, and trust your partner to listen to your safeword if you use one. And use it if you need to.

That doesn’t mean “trust your first time to just anyone who happens to come along.” It means, choose a partner you can trust, one you can communicate with and who will take your safeword seriously and/or use the safeword themselves.

See what we mean about vanilla people learning useful perspectives on sex from people who play with BDSM?

Plenty can go awry with vanilla sex—trust us, we know. But if you are tying people up, flogging them, giving them orders, and exploring the outer limits of sensation, even more can go wrong. To enjoy these practices, people must communicate clearly and honestly about their desires, limits, levels of experience, health status, and, once play starts, how they’re doing in the moment. We’re not encouraged to talk that explicitly about sex in our culture; many people are too shy to speak up. But in BDSM, communication is crucial.

We mentioned health status: in a BDSM negotiation that doesn’t just mean disclosing that you might have an STI. In fact, with some BDSM activities this wouldn’t even be relevant. We do mean that you need to speak up if you have a bad back, carry an asthma inhaler, tend to have panic attacks, or are wearing contact lenses (because blindfolds can put pressure on your eyes). Anything that makes your body react uniquely is important; anything that might go wrong in a scene is important to forestall. Even food allergies—a perfectly kind lover could think it’s sexy to blindfold you and feed you a strawberry, but before you even know what’s happening your face puffs up just from the juice running along your lips.

To boldly state what you do and do not want requires self-esteem. You’re not just along for the ride, whatever happens—you are looking to co-create an extraordinary experience. Negotiation allows you to do that. And if, as you negotiate, you have a less-than-great feeling about your potential partner, it’s your right to take a pass, or negotiate a different activity.

Vanilla folks—are you still there? Still relevant!





Scenes


Once you decide what you are and are not going to do, you can engage in a scene. This is what an erotic encounter, or a unit of play, is called in the world of BDSM. Some scenes might bear a strong resemblance to a date-with-sex in the vanilla world, except maybe there are dominant and submissive overtones. Some may include no sex—that is to say, genital play—at all, but involve bondage, sensation, or other activities. Some scenes start with the dominant partner putting a collar or other role signifier on the submissive one, which allows them to go into “scene space”: that’s an altered state in which their real-world roles are suspended and they act out different facets of their personalities. But not all BDSM involves dominance and submission, so the collaring ritual may be entirely absent in many kinds of scenes.

In most cases, though, a scene is somewhat theatrical; it has a beginning and an end and probably involves props, and possibly roles and special garments. So this language of the theatre is appropriate, and sometimes people find that the alternative roles of BDSM free them up to communicate more clearly, feel more sexual, or enjoy a wider variety of experiences.





Endorphins & the Elusive Definition of “Pain”


We’ve heard it so many times: “Why do they like that? How can they possibly eroticize pain?”

But the “pain” of an SM scene—that’s the “sadist and masochist” part of the BDSM term—isn’t the same as menstrual cramps or slamming your finger in the car door. It’s controlled and administered, usually, in a way that maximizes erotic overtones, and many people don’t think of it as pain at all. Like Cynthia Slater, we always like to call it “intense sensation.”

There’s another reason someone might like this kind of kinky play, though: exercise, intense sensation and pain temporarily alter the body’s chemistry. Our bodies produce endorphins—endogenous morphines—that allow us to process these experiences. If you’ve ever experienced “runner’s high,” you’ve had a taste of this altered state. There are other brain and body chemicals at play, too, including adrenaline, and all can make an experience that may seem un-sexy or even scary-looking from the outside induce ecstasy for the person who’s engaging in the endorphin-boosting acts.

We hope our vanilla friends are still eavesdropping, because endorphins aren’t just for kinky people—they are produced during vigorous intercourse and high sexual arousal, too, so we don’t want to hear any kinky people bragging about endorphins as if they alone experience them.





Bondage


Beginning Bondage


Bondage/restraint is one of the most common sexual fantasies; some people dream of immobilizing their lover, while others find the idea of being tied up exciting. A few key tips will make exploring bondage fun and erotic—as well as safe—for you and your partner. Please read this section even if bondage isn’t your main fantasy; you will find more overarching points about kinky play here amidst our discussion of knot-tying.

Before you get started with bondage, it’s a good idea to talk with your partner about what excites you about the idea of restraint—if you can put your finger on it. For the person who wants to be tied up, it might be the act of giving up control and being at their partner’s mercy. Being overcome, especially when restrained, means to some people that they are not entirely responsible for the lovely, nasty activities that ensue. Maybe it’s hot just being unable to move. Or it could be about the excitement of struggling and straining against the ropes or cuffs. Different desires mean different approaches to bondage. For example, if it’s the fantasy of having your partner in charge that excites you, you might choose a lighter set of restraints—but if you want to pull and struggle against your bonds, you’ll need something more heavy-duty. We will discuss the details later, but knowing which of these elements you want to try affects what accoutrements you need to gather to make your fantasies come true.

If you’re not sure what it is about bondage that turns you on, pick up a kinky-beginners erotica book and pay attention to which stories make you swoon. One way to use your favorite tales, besides a little one-handed reading, is to highlight the sections you find especially arousing, and share the book with a partner; then they can highlight their favorite scenes, too. You might not want to act them out as though they were your personal sex script—but maybe you do. If so, watch out for the author’s familiarity with safety rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Some of these stories are pure fantasy, after all.





Getting Started Means Safety & Technique Homework


Before you haul out the restraints, you should become familiar with safety tips to make sure that your bedroom fun stays fun. Bondage can be freeing and lovely or it can be dangerous—even with well-intentioned lovers, not to mention not-so-loving ones.

This is an area where you need to bone up on your lessons, read all safety tips carefully and be sure to understand them, before trying this at home! BDSM is absolutely not like the areas where we recommended that you just experiment—suggesting, for instance, that you might love finding your G-spot but if not, you and your partner will have some laughs trying, no harm done—this is an area where yes, you can definitely encounter harm if you do things wrong. So read up, and pull out the highlighters.

And we saved the most important tip for last: Do not be too tipsy when you get out the rope. Do we mean drunk? Yes indeed we do, or any other kind of high that sometimes enhances your willingness and comfort to “go there” sexually. If you need a drink or three before a BDSM scene, don’t do the scene!

Does it seem like we are taking the fun out of the scene? Not if you love bondage, because it means you are spending more time with a topic that titillates and interests you. Let’s compare people who are “foodies”: they like to read cookbooks, watch cooking shows, or take classes, in addition to actually cooking or eating a fabulous creation, and then they share pictures and recipes on top of it all. Doing safety homework, planning a scene, buying accessories or creating and crafting accessories at home, testing and thinking out how to properly use rope and equipment are analogous to a foodie testing out a new recipe before serving it at a birthday brunch.





Choose Your Education


Although bondage websites can be fun to watch, they’re not the best source of how-to information unless they clearly state they’re educational, not just sexy entertainment. Professional bondage models are often more flexible than most of us; in addition, photos can be digitally altered. The professionals you’re watching have an entire crew available to get someone out of bondage in a hurry if necessary. We will get you started, but please, buy a book or DVD from a respected and qualified educator like Midori, Lee Harrington, the Two Knotty Boys, or Tristan Taormino. Better yet, if you can, take a class. We’re not being worried mother hens here: Bondage, because it can put the body into stress positions and bind the limbs, can result in pulled muscles and even nerve damage. If you are really turned on you might not notice bodily warning signs—you might not be aware of damage happening. Many people think of it as a kind of “BDSM lite”—but bondage is a serious practice and its capacity to injure as well as arouse must be respected.





Safewords


Choose a safeword. A safeword is a code word or phrase that means “stop” or “I need a break.” There are two important reasons to use a safeword. First, some people get more turned on when they pretend to be struggling. If saying “No! No! Please stop!” turns you on, then it’s important to have a clear way to tell your partner when you really mean stop. Second, the word “no” can be challenging for some people to say or to hear, especially in a passionate moment. A safeword is often much easier. Some examples of safewords include: red for “stop”, yellow for “slow down”, and time out. You can opt for a fancier word if you like, but these are simple and clear. If you’re using a gag to muffle your partner’s moans, give them something to hold in their hand that they can drop on the floor if they need to call a time out. A set of keys works well; some people use a rubber ball.





Allow Wiggle Room


Make sure that you can slip two fingers between the restraints and the wrists or ankles, the way you would when you put a collar on a pet dog or cat. The more restricting the bondage, the shorter the amount of time that someone can stay in it. Give your partner some wiggle room and you’ll be able to keep going longer. Another reason for wiggle room is that tight bondage can cause nerve damage and cut off circulation, especially if your partner likes to struggle. That can also cause possibly permanent harm to the hands and feet. (Never do bondage around the neck, and if you use a collar, the two-finger rule applies.)

Check your partner’s circulation regularly. Squeeze the tip of their finger to force the blood out; this will lighten the skin quite a bit in most people. See if the blood flows back right away and returns the skin to its normal color. This may not work as well on darker-skinned people, but you can usually see this color change in the fingernail bed. If your partner in bondage reports tingling or numbness, it’s a bad sign—remove the bondage right away.





Choose Your Position Wisely


Tying someone standing up gives you a lot less time to play than if they’re lying down. Standing bondage, especially hands-over-head or hands-out-to-the-sides, can result in dizziness and even fainting—for some people this happens surprisingly soon after bondage or hands-over-head positioning begins. It sometimes even happens right at the moment you untie them, so pay attention. This is a danger because the blood will have drained from the arms during over-the-head bondage; when their arms are loosened and lowered, blood flows back in from the head. To prevent a fall, support your partner’s weight when you remove them from hands-up bondage. If everything is going as planned, release slowly and carefully so the blood flows out of the head slowly, in order to not make them dizzy, and have a chair to sit in or your cuddle pose ready.





Quick Escape


For suspension bondage you will always want to have a quick-release piece of hardware, formally called a “panic snap,” which allows quick release of a load without lifting—in other words, you can get your partner down without lifting their entire weight up and over the edge of a clip. Panic snaps are found in equestrian stores as well as bondage stores and websites. Furthermore, it’s important to be able to undo any bondage in a hurry. Surprises, natural disasters and emergencies do occur, so be prepared. Use carabiners to attach your rope to the bed or other tie-down point, and you can unclip it in an instant. A pair of blunt-tipped safety scissors of the kind used for bandages can cut through rope without hurting the skin underneath. We strongly recommend them for all rope bondage.





Ropes or Restraints?


The quickest, safest and simplest way to get started with bondage is with a set of restraints or cuffs. The easiest kind to use buckle around the wrist or ankles and can be adjusted to fit anyone. You can attach a piece of rope or chain to the loop on the restraint and secure the other end to a bed frame or other furniture, or connect the cuffs to each other. And when you’re done, you might even leave the rope in place to make the next time faster. You can also find restraints that use Velcro® and/or tie on. Watch out for tightness with these; ties or tethers made of silky material can tighten up by themselves without you being aware of it. This will make them harder to remove, and might also cause circulation and nerve problems of the kind mentioned above. (This is why it’s better to use restraints than a silk scarf or necktie for bondage—these seem romantic or handy when used in romance or detective novels—or on the covers of bestselling books—but in real life they just aren’t smart.)

Buckling restraints have a lot of advantages. It’s easy to use them safely and to get them on and off quickly. And no matter how much you pull on them, they won’t get tighter. That makes them a better choice than scarves or neckties that can tighten around the wrists when pulled. Fabric restraints are lighter in weight, but may be less durable. Leather is heavier, but can stand up to more use. Restraints are made from many different materials, so whatever you’re looking for, you can probably find it.

Rope bondage can be super-sexy, a profound experience of erotic exploration, and a way of learning about trust and control. It can also be meditative for the person tying the knots as well as a hot demonstration of merit-badge-level rope work, and more. Again, all of the above only comes with safety, knowledge and technique. You can find great instructional books, complete with photos, that teach you to safely start tying up your partner. Good Vibrations hosts workshops on bondage techniques with some of the most skilled teachers around. When you try rope bondage, get cotton or nylon rope rather than scratchy and rough materials like jute or plastic clothesline; plastic rope that isn’t scratchy is often so smooth that, like slippery silk, it will get tighter when you don’t want it to.





I Want Handcuffs!


We don’t recommend handcuffs because they’re not as safe as restraints. Toy handcuffs, including those sold at novelty shops and most adult stores, can tighten down around the wrists and damage the nerves, tendons and blood vessels of the hands. They’re narrow and completely inflexible, which puts a lot of pressure on the wrists, even when lined with fake fur. Even professional police handcuffs, which can be locked into position so they don’t tighten down further, have the potential for this kind of damage. And don’t forget—with the real cuffs, you’re screwed if you lose the key! Restraints are a much safer way to achieve the same effect.





OK, I’m Educated, Stocked Up & Safety Ready…Now What?


Bondage play is limited only by your imagination, the safety precautions previously mentioned, and your partner’s desire or willingness to explore being restrained. You did check that out before you got the cuffs, right? Here are a few ideas to get you started.

Have your partner lie on the bed while you tie their hands above their head. You can keep their arms together or held apart. You can also tie their legs open, with or without hands tied down. Try this face up or face down. Once you’ve gotten your lover in one of these positions, we’re sure you can think of something to do with them.

Get creative with the furniture. Bend your partner over a footstool or table and tie them to the legs. Or secure their wrists to their ankles. They’ll tip over easily like this unless you attach them to something stable; watch out that they can’t fall and hit something that might hurt them. Tie your partner’s feet to the legs of a chair and their wrists to the chair’s arms. While their genitals may or may not be available, there are many other delicious and nefarious things you can do—read on for some ideas.

Investigate portable bondage gear if you don’t want to have hooks and chains hanging around 24/7. There are some fun restraints and straps setups that transform the average bedroom into a luxurious version of a dungeon.

Put restraints on your partner’s wrists and clip them together behind their back. This makes their chest and breasts arch forward—doing lovely or nasty things to their nipples is bound to be at least one thought that occurs to you when you see them in this position. By the way, don’t throw a partner down on the bed to have your way with them if they are tied up like this. That’s a recipe for a safeword-inducing injury.





Blindfolds


Blindfolds add a thrill to bondage. The blindfolded partner obviously can’t see what the other person is doing, only feel the sensations. Lack of sight intensifies the bottom’s focus on the other senses. Plus, if you’re new to bondage, you may feel more comfortable knowing your partner can’t see you. It won’t matter if you fumble a little as you’re literally learning the ropes.

How about stroking your partner with a feather? Or a glove covered in fur? Ice cubes? If you don’t have long fingernails, trail a bamboo skewer down their skin. Massage lotions and massage candles are a great way to tease a partner who can’t move. Feed them sensual treats. Almost anything can be a great toy and help you explore the skin and other sources of sensation, especially when combined with bondage.





Spanking & Experiencing Impact


Whether you know for sure you want to explore every last element of sadomasochism, a.k.a. “intense sensation play,” you might be curious about impact play, which is a word that refers to all kinds of striking: spanking, slapping, flogging, caning, whipping, and all the rest. This can be a confusing scene to begin—which flogger or cane, paddle or whip will you like? You can’t tell by looking at an impact toy how intense it will feel—at least, not until you’ve had more experience with this kind of play. Elements that make a difference in the level of pain induced by any given toy are flexibility, thickness, surface width, as in paddles, whether it has a hard core inside, and the material it’s made of. A cane made of one single stalk of rattan is usually much more focused and intense than a many-tailed flogger—the former is thin, moderately flexible, and increases in speed as it swishes through the air towards its target; the latter, with all its soft tails, spreads the impact out over a greater area.

But you don’t need special gear at first, or maybe ever. Spanking can be a good place to start experimenting with impact and sensation.

Spanking, whether it’s done with a toy or by hand, is something people enjoy for many different reasons. Spanking can feel great purely on the level of sensation. And it’s a thrill to do something naughty. It can become so intense that it causes a rush of endorphins; it can be a way to test your own limits. It might be part of role-play or an SM scene, and is sometimes the culminating activity.

A Spanking Good Fantasy: Before you get started on a spanking adventure, talk with your partner about what excites you about it. Remember our talk about role-play and fantasy? Does spanking—doing it, or getting it done to you—fit your character in a fantasy? If you want to try something naughty, engaging in role-play may give you a context for that naughtiness.

Or you might just be curious about the feeling of being spanked, the sensation of your skin being slapped. If so, then a role might be irrelevant, with position being more important. Consider getting into a position that allows maximum comfort; the sensation of spanking will be more intense if you can’t relax. Also, for role-play and/or sensory reasons, many people like to be positioned lying across their spanker’s lap—it can feel secure and intimate, and it allows the “spankee” to rub their genitals on the thigh or knee of the spanker. If you want your spanking scene to get overtly sexual, this is a good position to facilitate that.

As always, you are much more likely to get what you want if you talk openly with your partner about it. If you haven’t already done so, you might pick up a book or video on spanking—either a how-to or some titillating erotica that incorporates spanking scenes to get you in the mood. This will help you communicate with your partner, because you can share the book, movie or story with them and use it as a jumping-off point to decide what you want to do together. Remember, though, that erotic scenarios may or may not follow reality, safety, and the limitations of the physical body: Someone wrote the story or made the movie to entertain and arouse, not necessarily to educate.

By the way, you might not have a partner right now, or you may have a vanilla partner who’s not interested in kink; so you want access to kinky sweeties or playmates. We’ll get into that, don’t worry.

Spanking, of course, is not only an adult pleasure—it’s also an experience many of us endured as kids for reasons that bear no resemblance to this kind of adult play. There’s no evidence that being spanked as punishment creates a taste for spanking in adulthood—if anything, it could bias a person against ever trying it. But regardless of a person’s youthful history around spanking, this kind of “punishment” is sometimes part of an adult age-play fantasy where “Daddy” or “Mommy” spanks the “little boy” or “girl.” Emotional feelings can run strong during any BDSM play, and certainly spanking is no exception; some people will engage in it just for the sensation, others to re-wire their experiences, and still others because they thrill to the intense experience of humiliation or embarrassment that can be—but isn’t always—connected with this kind of play.





Over a Knee, Kinkily


Here are some safety tips to help ensure that your spanking exploration is a positive experience.

Depending on your scene—that is to say, the context of the spanking—you might need a safeword. This is a word you use to signal “stop” or “slow down,” which means that you can shout “NO! Stop!” to your heart’s content, if that makes the scene more exciting. “No means no” in sex play unless you have negotiated its use as a way to emphasize roles; many people into BDSM like to play with fantasies of force or duress, so they’ll say “red” or “mercy” or a random phrase like “sweet potato” when they really want to stop.

If you’re new to erotic spanking, it’s a good idea to focus your attention on the butt. There’s a lot you can do on the butt cheeks where the body is usually well-padded, so you don’t need to worry about causing damage. When spanking someone’s bottom, you indirectly stimulate their genitals, especially if they’re in a position that allows them to rub against your leg or a piece of furniture. Did we hear someone ask, “Why on earth do people like to be spanked?” Well, this is one reason.

Be careful to avoid hitting the tailbone and never strike the kidneys. If you go on to become a spanking and impact aficionado, you might be interested in some of the more advanced techniques that include body parts other than the butt, so you’ll want to know which zones are no-go’s. Check out how-to books or classes for helpful information. Besides the kidneys, don’t strike joints, breasts or other body parts with implants, any fibrocystic breast tissue, or the neck and head.

Many people find that the sensation of spanking varies along a continuum of sting to thud. This is true of other impact play as well—anything that involves striking or hitting. Stinging sensations tend to be felt on the surface of the skin, while thudding sensations go deeper. Different toys and hand positions create different sensations, so you might need to experiment a bit. Also, some people have strong preferences for one style and feel over the other, while some like varying kinds of sensations.

You may find that as you get turned on, things start to feel different. Sexual arousal increases our ability to handle stronger and more intense sensations, so it’s a good idea to start off lightly and ramp it up as the spankee gets more aroused. Combining or alternating spanking with other types of stimulation, including direct genital play, is a sexy way to increase pleasure. Or you might want to get turned on before you start spanking. Lots of people like to switch from spanking to gentle caresses or using a fur or fleece glove. Play around with it and you’ll discover what feels good to you.

The more comfortable you both are, the more fun your spanking sessions will be. Prop yourself up with pillows and you’ll be able to relax into the sensation. Ordinary couch cushions work great, or you can use position furniture specially designed for sex.





Toys or Hands?


Hands are very versatile when it comes to spanking. If you bring your fingers together or cup your hand, you’ll get more thud. If you spread your fingers or keep your palm flat, you’ll get more sting. Try a little of each and ask your partner which feels better. Try spanking in different spots and see how that changes the feelings. Just as your hand is striking a butt, the butt is also striking your hand! Not only will a well-spanked ass get a reddened glow, so will the hand that spanked it.

Toys are a wonderful way to create sensations that hands just can’t deliver. Leather slappers and spankers are usually lighter in feel, though they can make a loud slapping noise that will definitely get your attention. Paddles can be made from almost any material: the more rigid and/or heavier, the stronger the sensation. Be sure to hit with the middle of the paddle—if you hit with the edge, it can be unpleasant, and maybe even leave a bruise. Crops make a great whistling sound when you swing them and they create very strong sensations. Start off lightly and ramp it up. Canes can also be very intense. When we say “intense,” remember, we mean sensation that certainly can include pain—while some people love impact so much that they literally do not feel it hurts, others definitely feel pain at least in response to some techniques. Some will want to get into the pain—while others will want to avoid it altogether. When you’re negotiating with your partner, it’s good to know which kind of spankee you are. If you don’t know, communicate as you go along, and remember your safeword. Also, sometimes only the experienced players know the sting of the toy or tool involved—so you might be taken by surprise with the pain. Sometimes a crop or whip that looks more harmless than another can actually hurt more; for example, a single inflexible crop hurts more than a flogger.

Speaking of bruises: Some people like them—they’re even proud of them! Others feel very differently about marks, however. Bruises are a form of bodily damage, though people generally heal readily from them and you can do more injury during a friendly game of softball. Learn what kinds of marks different sorts of impacts make so you and your partner can negotiate clearly about this.

Whatever you’re using, begin slowly and gently to give your partner a chance to get used to it. Stop every few minutes and stroke them—with fur gloves, fingernails, ice cubes, or other toys that vary sensation and enliven the skin. Mix it up a bit and use a vibrator on their genitals or anus. Put nipple clamps on the spankee. Spread massage cream on their skin. For a really wild ride, slide an anal plug into your partner. There’s no limit to how creative you can get with spanking.





Clips & Clamps


Another toy in many BDSM toybags is the nipple clamp, but clips, including clothespins, and clamps are also enjoyed by many people on other areas of the body, especially the genitals. They impart a feeling of mild squeeze to intense pinch, depending on the implement; the most intense part of clip or clamp play comes when the item is removed and blood rushes back in. With that in mind, we recommend keeping clamps on for twenty minutes or less, though some experienced players will enjoy them for longer durations.





Fetish Fun for Everyone


“Kink” is sometimes used as another word to describe BDSM desires, but “the kink community” includes another sort of erotic fun: the world of fetishes. You can think of a fetish as any kind of sexy response that isn’t to another whole person; for example, legs or red hair, or an item or material to which you have an especially strong erotic response. There are zillions of possible fetishes, but some very common ones include leather, latex, satin, panties, boots or shoes, stockings or pantyhose, long hair (in various areas of the body), shaved body areas (from heads to genitals), smoking, being encased in tight clothing or hoods… really, we mean it when we say there are zillions of things you might find especially, intensely erotic. We say hooray for fetishes! They make the already-interesting world of human sexuality into a veritable panorama of possibility.

Back in the early days of psychology and sexology there was a rather rigid definition of a fetish: an eroticized object, body part, or unusual activity without which a person couldn’t even get turned on or function sexually. By “unusual act” we mean something like watching a someone blow smoke rings or urinate—not the sort of “foreplay” activities we’d usually think of when we consider what it takes to really get turned on. Fetishes were things the average person might not ever see as sexy, or would not respond to in the focused and intense way of a fetishist. It’s one thing to say, “Wow, those sure are sexy shoes!” It’s quite another to think, “Without those shoes, I cannot get turned on or come.”

Today a fetish is commonly referenced without this implied loss of control—the notion that you are at the mercy of the things you find sexy. Instead, it’s more likely to be defined positively, as something you’re especially into or erotically responsive to. Some people even use the term in a non-sexual way: “I have such a fetish for chipotle hummus!” But let’s keep it sexy here, shall we? For our purposes, let’s imagine those elements of your erotic life that truly add something extra, without which sex or attraction just isn’t as hot: That guy with the moustache is hotter than the bare-faced guy. The slinky charmeuse makes you feel so much sexier than the little cotton chemise. Those shoes are so cute, but they’re flats—you only get charged up when you put on high heels. The very smell of leather gets you hard or wet. Fetishes increase your responsiveness and turn-on when you experience them, and they probably also feature in your fantasies.

The newer understanding of “fetish” moves it away from the old-school definition’s implication that a fetish is a compulsion or obsession. Of course, you could be obsessive or compulsive about a sexual fetish, but that is not inherent in its definition—anything that gives you extra erotic juice is not necessarily a compulsion to be concerned about. It’s equally or more likely that you could be compulsive about something with no sexual element at all: You could buy too many pairs of shoes that you can’t afford but still never develop an erotic thrill for high heels. Feeling compelled to amass a collection isn’t the same thing as a fetish.

Let’s look at just one example of a popular, common fetish: those sexy shoes we just mentioned. For many, the shoes themselves are fetishized: hot to wear, even to view in the shoe store. Do they perhaps have red soles that remind you of vulvas? Do they have pointed toes that show toe cleavage? Do they have platforms or spike heels? Some like shoes on other people: the way high heels make the wearer’s ass and legs look, or how it feels to worship at the feet of an imperious mistress. Some like to smell the shoes after the wearer has stepped out of them. Some fantasize being walked on. And then there’s the way these high heels, coded in our culture as feminine attire, make someone feel who is not female or feminine; a cross-dresser may well have a more powerful fetish for wearing those shoes than the Mistress does! Speaking of our sometimes-gendered erotic world, big butch boots can be just as powerful a fetish object as those flirty femme high heels. Some even like to sit astride that butch boot and ride it to orgasm.

Then there’s the very interesting case of latex fetishism. Someone who’s into latex might wear rubber garments—these can be found at most shops that carry leather gear and clothing. The look and feel of the sleek rubber is hot for a latex fetishist, as might be its distinctive smell. But a latex fetish may not stop at getting dressed up in stretchy, shiny clothes. Some latex fans find condoms and rubber gloves especially sexy too—see how handy that would be for your safer sex lifestyle? Plus latex is a natural substance that comes from trees; as we will see in the next section, even that is something that could give rise to fetishistic yearnings!

So what’s your fetish? Do you have one—or several? If you do, you may already know how a fetish can animate your sex life and supercharge your sexual feelings.





Ecosexual & Ecorotic


Being environmentally frisky is nothing new. Folks have made love under stars, on the beach, and against strong, towering trees probably for as long as there have been humans. But now, with many feeling that nature is in jeopardy, a movement of sex-positive people are creating a culture and taking on a commitment to protect our planet, our natural resources, and therefore ourselves. Some people call this being Ecosexual, while at Good Vibrations we use the term Ecorotic® for products that are easier on the planet’s ecology and our own bodies, whether because their carbon footprint is low or because they are made from more healthful materials. For many of our customers, this supports an awareness that affects what they buy and use. Sex is part of our lives, so any issue that concerns us out of the bedroom has implications inside it: If we recycle, buy local produce, watch our carbon use, and think ecologically in other ways, it makes sense to do the same when we make sexual choices.

Are you an Ecosexual? Being an ecosexual isn’t exactly a way to engage in sex that compares to the way that we might teach BDSM or oral sex techniques. There isn’t a simple “how-to” for ecosexuals. Rather, it’s a consciousness, a value system affecting daily life, including sexual awareness. Does making love under the stars count if you can’t see them because of smog? When you fantasize about rolling on the beach with a lover do you picture seaweed-entangled plastic bags and sandy water bottles littering the surf lapping at your legs? You can’t get any leverage making out against a tree when there are no trees but only clear-cut, eroding mountains.

Ecosexuals[iii] Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens lead by example, creating and using sexual art to bring attention to the environment, as well as the pure freedom and pleasure of enjoying nature and respecting Mother Earth—though they would prefer we take it further by thinking of Earth as our lover, not our mother. They encourage us to recognize ways in which we get turned on by the earth and natural phenomena—for instance, do any of these natural wonders turn you on: rushing water, lightning and thunder, sandy beaches, beautifully-shaped stones, warm rainstorms, crisp windy days? The list can go on and on, and it turns out that some tree-huggers feel their identity in a literal sense!

People around the world, inspired by this vision, realizing that they do get turned on by Nature, have joined in, some even considering their primary sexual identity to be Ecosexual. Of course you can have a more common primary sexual identity, like being heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, LGBTQQ or anything along the continuum, and still respond to other kinds of erotic possibilities, including ecosexuality. In fact, a lot of these ideas started in the Radical Faerie community many decades ago. The whole idea of the Faeries is that for gay men, sexuality is spirituality and spirituality requires a connection to nature; thus they believe sex in nature is one of the most enlightening and spiritual practices in which one can participate, whether with a partner or a meditative solo session.

Other people might not be ready to marry the sun or moon, as Annie and Beth have done, but given a choice between shopping in a way that is healthier for themselves and the environment versus not doing so, they would gladly choose the former. Many of our customers want to do their best to protect the environment, and so do we. In 2001, Good Vibrations was the first company in the United States to research items containing phthalates (chemical softeners that have raised concerns about toxicity in plastics; some studies have linked them to cancer and sperm damage). We immediately began seeking safer alternatives. In 2007, we became the first multi-channel retail company to discontinue these products, and encouraged our manufacturers to do the same. We are proud of our role as leaders in helping our industry begin to question and change its practices regarding materials, packaging, and other issues impacting sustainability. As early as 1994, in fact, Good Vibrations consulted an expert to determine whether the clear jelly rubber butt plug we had gotten in stock was safe to use and sell; we were informed that the material was PVC and were recommended that we suggest using a condom over it and all insertable toys, especially non-silicone ones, for safety and hygiene’s sake. To this day the simple latex or plastic condom is the only FDA-approved material for safe insertion. It is used daily in clinics and bedrooms around the world.

The adult industry hasn’t always focused on green issues, but times are changing, and we have more access to better products than ever before. When it comes to sexual pleasure and health, we want products that feel good and that we can also feel good about. We consider several factors when we choose a product for our Ecorotic collection. While opinions may vary regarding a given item’s eco-friendliness, and most consumer products, not just adult ones, affect the environment more than we might wish, we believe that our Ecorotic items are a step in the right direction. Some not only make a difference but are standard-setting for the adult toy marketplace.

Many of the lubricants we carry are made from natural and/or organic ingredients. They are produced in the United States, rather than overseas, which reduces their carbon footprint, the resources used to create a product and bring it to market. And some of our own private-label products are made right in our part of the country, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We’ve added rechargeable battery vibrators to the Ecorotic collection because they don’t use disposable batteries and are more durable and long-lasting—all of which reduces waste. The same can be said of popular “old-school” corded electric vibrators, which tend to last longer than battery vibes, often by many years. Although the Magic Wand has to make the trip from Japan, it can last for decades, so compared to a battery vibe from China, for example, the waste and carbon footprint is much less. The longer a toy stays in use and out of the trash, the more Ecorotic it is.

Other items are chosen for the Ecorotic collection based on the long-lasting materials used to make them, such as glass, sustainably harvested wood, metal, or silicone products. Some other materials will break down over time and need to be replaced, while these, with proper care, can last a lifetime. They are less likely to end up in landfill, and many of these items are themselves recyclable. In addition to being more durable, high-grade, non-permeable materials are safer for your body and more natural than most plastics and composites. These toys, too, are usually made in the USA.





Recycling and Biodegradability


A biodegradable sex toy might sound like a good idea, but we’re concerned it could also break down in the body and cause irritation or infection. But remember our discussion about cucumbers and other garden options—your biodegradable dildo awaits you in the produce aisle.

We’re sometimes asked about recyclable products as well. At this time, there are no known facilities that recycle sex toys, both because of the materials they’re made of as well as concerns about worker safety and sexually transmitted infections. If this sort of business were to launch in the United States, we would certainly make our customers aware of it, and we strongly encourage recyclers to develop the technology to make this possible.

Being made of materials that have been tested for safety can also warrant a product’s inclusion on our Ecorotic list. None of our toys contain phthalates, and we carry as many silicone items as possible, as these are regarded as the most body-safe items in the world of sex toys. As we learn information about other materials, we adapt our selection to incorporate new findings.

In addition to materials, we consider other factors when thinking about Ecorotic products. Companies that manufacture locally and therefore have a minimal carbon footprint, those who use minimal and/or recyclable packaging, and companies that work to keep their operations as green as possible can all be included on this list, as all these efforts help our industry move towards sustainability.





Ecorotic Characteristics


Body-safe—Sex toys are made from many different materials, with varying amounts of information available about them, and many have not been tested for safety. We always choose better-quality items, and we give special attention to those we know to be safer.

Animal-friendly—You might be surprised by how many items contain animal products. You can be sure that any earning our Ecorotic® stamp of approval aren’t made with any, nor have they been tested on animals.

Rechargeable—Toys that can be recharged reduce the number of batteries that end up in landfill. We encourage you to use rechargeable batteries if your favorite vibrator operates using disposables.

Natural ingredients—More products, especially lubricants, are being made from natural ingredients. Less processing and fewer artificial materials means a product is more Ecorotic.

Recyclable Packaging/Materials—When the package and/or material for your toy can be recycled, you reduce the impact of your purchase on the environment.

Made in the USA—Many sex toys and products are produced overseas. Choosing one that’s manufactured and assembled in the United States reduces shipping and has a lower carbon footprint.

While we wish that all sex toys were environmentally friendly, not all our products receive an Ecorotic rating. We’re committed to carrying a range of quality toys to serve the needs of our diverse customer base. We believe that as awareness grows, more manufacturers will make increasingly more earth- and body-friendly options available. In the meantime, we believe in giving you as many choices as possible to experience the pleasure that is your birthright.

When we buy any kind of product, we exert some sort of impact on the earth. We can all practice harm reduction in our shopping choices just as we can in our sexual decision-making, selecting better-quality and greener items whenever they are available. By doing so, manufacturers get the message that Good Vibrations and our customers care not only about quality, health and pleasure, but also about the planet.





Threesomes, Swinging, Sex Parties, and Orgies, Oh My!


Sex parties can be once-in-a-while exciting adventures, or they can be lifestyle basics, if this kind of explicit sexual environment turns you on, makes you feel like having sex, gives you high or altered energy and an exhibitionistic buzz, or feels cathartic or healing. Don’t underestimate how positively mind-blowing it can be to see all that sex going on around you. Many find their sense of shame crumbles by seeing dozens or hundreds of people visibly seeking pleasure. It’s one thing to know that lots of people in your town are probably having sex right now—it’s an entirely different matter to see it.

Threesomes are not only one of the top vote-getters on the Fantasy Top 40, they’re also an intimate mini-sex party and a perfect excuse to bring a little bisexuality into your life. While same-sex threesomes don’t necessarily do that, of course, it’s hard to completely ignore the homoerotic potential of a “straight” ménage à trois. They’re also a great way to be lavished with attention, especially if you’re the “Lucky Pierre” in the sandwich—that is, the one in the middle.

Let’s consider these sociable sex options.





Threesomes and Foursomes


Three-way sex, and we’ll consider adding a second couple as a variation on this theme, is a popular fantasy for many reasons: since it often starts out with a couple, it seems like an accessible idea. Adding a third partner brings both the frisson of an open relationship and the opportunity to be in on the action; it’s a voyeuristic thrill to watch the other two, exciting to have more than one body to fondle, and an adventure to explore the non-linear sexual possibilities that can manifest themselves when there are more than two people in bed. Plus there are a few sex acts that require more than two people: double penetration without the assistance of sex toys, for instance, and oral sex during intercourse.

It’s not all extra breasts or cocks, though. Just because a threesome is a common sexual fantasy doesn’t mean it goes off without a hitch whenever it’s attempted in reality. Plenty of people have dreamed of turning their bedroom into a porno palace with their cute colleague from work, only to realize that they don’t know how to get the hottie from the next cube over into bed in the first place; how to negotiate what’s OK once they get there; or how to greet them when you see them at work on Monday. Worse, three-way sex is not always equally desired by all partners, and it can bring up painful jealousy and insecurity—sometimes even in the partner whose idea it was in the first place.

Some threesomes happen with people who are not in a primary relationship and just fall into bed together. Oftentimes they are friends or roommates, and chemistry takes over one night and it feels right. A magical moment feels safe and fun and perfect—hopefully, the entire time the friskiness ensues. Sometimes people have a few drinks, get horny and start having sex with each other—then they may or may not have regrets the next day. Sometimes the regret isn’t about the fun they had, but because they are worried about being judged—by each other or outsiders. When friends turn into friends-with-benefits for just one night, it’s best to ensure that you love and care for each other. If shame or questioning washes over you, think about it: Having a great time physically isn’t a reason to ruin a friendship. That’s old-fashioned judgment whispering in your ear. And if you think about it, why would a good time make you feel bad?

If you want to have a threesome with a primary partner—your girlfriend, boyfriend or spouse—and that situation doesn’t seem to be falling into your lap, talk about it first. Instead of inviting over one of your friends, or someone you’ve been lusting for at work—often an ill-conceived idea—look for a third who has some experience with this kind of play. Never just invite someone over with the intent of seducing them into a threesome, unless you know they come from a sexually frisky mental space and are more than likely to be up for it—that way, if they don’t turn out to be seduce-able, hopefully they are the kind of person who can laugh it off and let it go.

Be warned, if you are in a primary relationship: Due to our society’s presumption of monogamy, some friends/acquaintances/co-workers might feel comfortable flirting or being sexy with you and not want sex, i.e., not mean it that way. They might see you as safe and therefore the perfect person to flirt with because they presume it will never go anywhere. Sometimes this happens in gay/straight relationships. Someone presumes a friend is on one end of the scale, and flirts without taking it seriously, but the other might be bisexual and take flirtation in an unanticipated way. So that’s why it’s important to make thoughtful decisions before just laying a kiss on someone who doesn’t know that you and your partner are interested in a threesome. Even light-hearted advances can end a friendship when taken the wrong way, and get you in hot water with workmates to boot—making you the “Eww” guy or gal.

People who successfully have threesomes are often sex party or swing club veterans who’ve learned their social skills and sought out partners in a sexual environment—there are fewer surprises that way; instead of hoping your intended third will go for it after dinner, it helps to start the invitation with a clear statement of intention: “We think you’re hot and we were hoping you’d want to play with us.”

This still leaves the challenge of finding someone you both find attractive and enjoyable to be around, and you won’t know who that might be if you don’t talk about it up front with your partner. Just bringing home somebody who’s game as a surprise to your partner is not a guarantee you’ll get the threesome of your dreams.

Before the lucky third party or couple gets a front row seat to your relationship dynamics, make sure you’re good communicators together, and have discussed what you would and wouldn’t want to do in a threesome, as well as safer sex and boundaries—and then be prepared to discuss all that again, with your new three-way friend. Don’t just have sex. Talk about it. Shar always advises all parties to agree ahead of time that they will clearly say, “I am uncomfortable with what’s happening,” or even, “Stop, I need to talk,” if complicated feelings come up. She encourages you to wholeheartedly say that out loud to each other, and, furthermore, to say, if appropriate “Anything besides that is not a head trip­—so if I say ‘I have to go get a drink of water,’ then it means I am getting a drink of water, I am not pouting in the bathroom.” Otherwise, especially with those new to such frisky adventures, someone might leave the room and the others don’t know whether to keep on having fun or to chase after them and inquire if they are OK. Furthermore, if you decide to take this advice then you need to think this through: Are you good at saying your feelings out loud? Or are you the person likely to leave, expecting your partner to read your mind and know that they should run after you? We do not recommend the latter strategy—up-front communication has far fewer pitfalls than hoping your lover can read your deepest thoughts.

It helps to check in during the action with each other—including your third party. That’s only polite. “Are you feeling okay? Do you need anything?” And, lastly, compliments help. If you are watching your partner play with someone else and you think they look sexy doing so, say it. Say it out loud. If you are new at this, the intense look on your face might not convey what mind-blowing thoughts or sensations you’re having. Share with the group, please, and thank you.

Now for a few physical and practical tips.

If you don’t know if someone likes an activity, you can ask, “Is this hot for you? Do you like it? Want to do something else now?” Get everything out in the open—honest communication leads to the most fun.

Have a big pile of safer sex supplies within reach. If you are up to it physically, three-ways are a great way to try out different positions that you might want help with—that extra set of hands can be put to work holding hair, holding hips, touching clits, touching cocks, pinching nipples, hoisting a leg up, and a whole lot more. To some people, there’s nothing so sexy as being picked up and turned over, or passed around, and to others there’s nothing like the idea of waiting your turn or being the boss of who gets to go next. Look up the sections on fantasies and exhibitionism—this is a safe way to experience being watched in a consensual set-up, and it can also be an extension of fantasy or role-play—if you thought it was fun to play circus with only you as the lion tamer and your partner as the ringleader, what happens when you bring in a trapeze artist?

When threesomes and foursomes go right, they can lead to close connections and even ongoing play relationships. They can be smokin’ hot, like in the fantasy. You just have to engage in the complicated and sexy math problem that is, “Who does what? To whom? And in what order?” Ooh, that sounds like fun. It helps to learn how to manage feelings of possessiveness and fear. We’ll talk more about these emotions in our section on open relationships and polyamory. They may not come up, and if they don’t—great! You’re ahead of the game.





Swinging and Play Parties


If you’re good at threesomes, you can probably find a partner and negotiate for just about anything at a play party, and, as stated, these are excellent venues to seek partners for a three-way.

Swing clubs can be found all across the US and Canada and beyond, in small towns as well as big cities. Swingers assume that couples will attend together—almost always, a one-woman and one-man pairing is necessary to get in the door, though some clubs don’t mind admitting women without a male escort, and a few of them will even allow solo men if there are already more women at the party. But in general, single guys will not be welcome. Some swingers’ events are on-premises, meaning that the sex happens right there in the host’s home or other party venue. Others are off-premises; at the host’s house there may be dirty dancing, lots of flirting and maybe cocktails, but the sex relocates to a hotel room or at the home of one of the participants. Sometimes several couples spin off a small party at an off-premises event, taking the action elsewhere.

It’s common to see women getting sexy with each other among swingers, and rare to see men doing so—although some men in the swinger’s community are bisexual, and may come out if they perceive it to be safe.

Play parties have a lot in common with on-premises swing clubs, but there is generally no requirement for people to attend with a partner; however, some play parties try to balance attendees by gender. Some parties are comprised specifically of bi, queer, and genderqueer participants, and gender may not be an issue. Others are not specific at all about attendees’ orientation or identity, but open to various people without so many rules. When gender is an issue, it’s generally because a public sex environment with lots of men can feel unappealing or even unsafe to many women. Unless the guys are up for having sex with each other, a party with way more men than women does not feel balanced to the participants, and many may not get what they want out of the experience—though any person of any gender can find lots to look at at a play party, so please don’t wail, “I can’t even get laid at an orgy!” Instead, imagine how challenging it would be to convince forty or fifty people to have sex just so you could watch. Be grateful and enjoy!

Play parties sometimes have a specific focus: safer sex only, all-masturbation, kinky play encouraged, or any other theme the hosts dream up.





Dungeon Parties (or Kink or BDSM Parties)


A BDSM playspace is called a dungeon, and generally has specially designed furniture set up to accommodate bondage and other kinds of kinky play. These events might discourage or disallow genital sex, or may incorporate it enthusiastically. Every kinky party has its particular tone, so make sure you know the rules. The rules will almost always include a strict prohibition against entering a scene. Any sort of play party is a complex social environment, not a candy store, so keep your hands to yourself until you know whether you’re welcome in any given scenario. If you do see a scene you want to connect with, it’s wise to check with the top.





Orgies


Any sex party in which many people have sex all in one room qualifies as an orgy.

At any of these types of parties, a couple can—together or separately—find other partners, from threesomes to moresomes. Or a couple can simply get it on publicly, enjoying each other in all the exhibitionistic glory they can summon. A solo person, if the party in question is open to singles, can find one other person to play with, be the third in a couple’s threesome or get involved in an orgiastic puppy pile or a BDSM scene. Or three people who are not in a relationship with each other can have a threesome.

Be sure to bring your safer sex gear like condoms and lubricant, or find out if such products are provided. If you attend with a long-term partner, date or fuck-buddy, you need to clearly communicate with each other before you get there as to what you both hope for/expect and what you do not want. Set goals and limits: What does your ideal experience look like? What would be fun anyway, even if that didn’t happen? What might be an offer that you would prefer to refuse, for personal-preference or safety reasons?

If you go with a partner it needs to be someone who is compatible enough with you that you can both enjoy yourselves—and needless to say, but we’ll say it anyhow, they have to want to explore a group sex environment too. Don’t just drag someone to a sex party because you need a partner to get in the door. You will need to find an appropriate sex party where you are a good fit—vanilla or kinky? Gay, straight, or all of the above?—sometimes this involves traveling to a bigger city. Finally, we recommend you not have a few drinks before you go. Be in control of yourself; be a good citizen of sex, and have only the adventures you want to have.





What do I wear to the orgy?


The simple answer is “Dress sexy,” though that of course will mean different things to different people, and in some places, like parties held at private homes, you will be expected to arrive in street clothes that do not scream “Sex party inside!” Also, different parties will have different dress codes. There are few places to attend an orgy that don’t require you to reserve your spot in advance, since most parties have a limit to how many people can be accommodated by the space, and many vet potential participants via a phone or online interview to make sure the newcomer will fit in with the crowd. So your best bet is to ask the question about appropriate garb when you reserve your spot. If you want to go shopping right now in hopes of having the right clothes, here are some tips:

	 Unless your sex party friends are vegans, a leather look is generally considered erotic.

Fishnets, tight dresses, and lingerie—at least if you’re going for a femme gender presentation.

Sexy shoes or boots look great, even if that’s all you wind up wearing.

If you’re worried you might feel a little shy, consider a smoking jacket or robe.





Where do I find info about parties?


We know—you want us to put in a good word for you at the orgy. Here’s the bad news: Most sex party environments are not open to the public, but rather are private or semi-private. You can’t just walk up to a party venue and pay a cover charge, the way you can at a club. While you might be successful doing an Internet search for key words like “sex party,” “play party,” “dungeon party,” “swingers” and “orgy” (add the name of your town or vacation destination), this won’t always get you in the door. It’s a better bet to be referred by someone, and to find someone who already attends sexy parties, you have to be comfortable talking about such things and going to sexy environments. Become part of your community’s frisky sex-positive subcultures. Is there a burlesque club? Go there and chat with people. A sex store? Ask the staff, though they might not know—it’s a myth that all sex store staffers spend their off hours swinging from the chandeliers. Some are trying to get through college and they have way too much homework for such things. If your town has any sort of sex-positive subculture, go in search of it and join in. Once people know you, invitations may come.

If all else fails, talk to cab drivers. They often know exactly what’s going on in their town. But just so you know, not every city has its own orgy. The closest you will come in many places is a swing club—and remember, you need to have a partner to get in.





Tantra and Sacred Sex


Long ago and far away, in a culture decidedly non-Western and non-modern, Tantric sex practices were developed as one part of a holistic spiritual approach to life. Today you can find guidebooks about Tantra and even take classes, and many people have found these Yoga-like positions and intimate exercises to be extremely meaningful.

The word Tantra encompasses more than just sex. Historically it’s been defined as a divine body of teachings, or deep understanding about the world. It emerged in the context of Hinduism in the early centuries of the Common Era, though it influenced most other Asian religious/cultural contexts as well, and involved ritual of many kinds. No one doctrine or rigid set of practices defined it, so Tantra spread from place to place; it morphed into different schools and touched other religions as it moved through India and elsewhere. Most people in the West who call themselves Tantrikas—practitioners of Tantra—do not embrace historical Tantra in their daily lives, but rather an altered and abridged version. Sexuality earned its place even in ancient Tantric practice, though, because in Tantra, unlike some other spiritual systems, the world is not understood as merely an illusion to be transcended but rather, worldly practices such as eating and sex are invested with spiritual elements and significance, becoming vehicles for transcendence.

As Wikipedia notes, “The Tantric practitioner seeks to use prana—energy flowing through the universe, including one’s body—to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both.” This reference to energy is at the heart of Tantric erotic practice, even today. It may be experienced as breath enters and leaves the body, or as the connection between two people as they engage in eye-gazing and sexual intercourse. Early Tantra included the worship of Hindu deities Shiva and Shakti, whose relationship as “the divine couple” has no parallel in Western, Christian-based mainstream religious thought. Since they’re deities, and a couple, their lovemaking is significant beyond any traditional Western vision of sex, and sexual practices are elevated in certain branches of Tantra because they allow humans to connect, through sex, to the divine.

Maybe you’ve traveled, or watched travel TV, and seen what looks like a huge phallic symbol at the center of a religious temple. Imagine coming from a Western culture whose religious philosophies warn that the desires of the body limit communion with the Divine. Then you travel to a foreign land and see images of sex on temple walls and sculptures of phalluses at the altar—actually the holy Shiva lingam. This is exactly what happened when the British colonized India and encountered its sacred erotic art and temple rituals that had enlivened their culture for millennia. It’s easy to see how straitlaced 18th-century British colonists might get a little over-stimulated, and it’s completely understandable that you might mistake this behavior—as those colonists did—for some sort of fertility ritual, or even a religion based on sex!





Spiritual? Hindu? WTF?


Why on earth is a sex book going into ancient Hinduism and comparative world religions? You may be thinking, “Hey, I’m not going to do any sexual position that means I have to get all spiritual, or spiritual in some new way!”

Fair enough! But even if you don’t feel spiritual, you might find a lot to like about the Westernized sexual version of Tantra. It’s not necessarily a religion; some of its practitioners engage in a spiritual kind of belief system in connection with practicing its techniques—positions, breathing, and so forth—while others don’t. It’s comparable to the way many people in the West take yoga classes and never for a minute think of the Hindu pantheon. While we are talking about borrowing the sexual elements from an Eastern spiritual and religious history and not everyone may feel comfortable with that, it’s still the case that Tantric sex has jumped the fence into the United States and Europe, and has been in many notable ways divorced from its origins to become a set of contemporary sexual techniques.

So you might find Tantra relevant or useful or compelling in spite of its history and its relationship to spirituality. Or you might be drawn to it specifically because of these associations.





Spiritual Sex



The only perversion is to fuck without reverence or responsibility; the only perversion is to fuck without compassion.

	—Marco Vassi





Why are some people drawn to spiritual sex?

Some people, of course, feel that they have a spiritual relationship with something greater than themselves, however they conceptualize that ineffable experience that spiritual systems and religions seek to contextualize. Embracing spirituality as part of sex feels right to them, and they don’t have to ask whether or not they’re comfortable with this element of Tantra—it’s part of the reason they find it, or other forms of sacred sexuality practice, compelling.

Others seek comfort in spiritual sex that is not primarily about the sacred or divine: Instead, it’s a response to anti-sexual elements in the spiritual system or religion in which they were raised or that influenced the culture in which they live. In many types of conservative religion, sexuality is considered far from spiritual. Divorcing the body from the mind and spirit leaves many people feeling shame, or at least confusion, about their sexual actions or desires. Some people move away from a religious life for this very reason. Still others find the exploration of pro-sex spiritualities enlightening and healing.

To some people, the idea that sex can have spiritual significance speaks powerfully, as they feel connected to profound forces when they have sex. It’s in the act of making love that some of us feel connected, in a whole-body way, to something much bigger than ourselves. Even the most non-philosophically-inclined person might yell “Oh god!” at the moment of orgasm! This hints at where we are taken when swept away with pleasure—it carries us out of the mundane. And in the best erotic encounters we return peaceful, calm, deeply connected, and feeling alive. At its most basic, this is an altered state of consciousness we enter as a result of powerful sexual chemistry and the experience of deep pleasure. Even when the chemistry wears off, we continue to be affected.

Tantra and other sacred sex practices give people a context for the depth they feel in a powerful erotic experience because the Tantric or spiritual attitude towards sex (and all bodily processes) is that it is inherently wholesome, and potentially alchemical. In Tantric philosophy, human sexual union mimics the creative dance of the Divine, and therefore has transformational potential. If heterosexual erotic union can create physical life, then maybe all erotic union, entered into with consciousness and intentionality, can enliven us metaphysically. This is certainly the question modern Western Tantrikas are exploring. And their methods do not require you to acquire, or reject, any belief system to animate your love relationships. Nor does Tantra necessarily require you to physically contort yourself into pretzel-like positions. Breath, energy, eye-gazing, touch, prolonging orgasm—these are all simple Tantric techniques that can bring about transformation. They can also simply be employed to slow down the mind, focus attention on the present moment, and open the heart and body to greater sensitivity.

In addition to Tantra and Taoist techniques, some are drawn to Pagan and Goddess spiritualities for their different, and sex-positive, views.





Modern Tantric Sex–Techniques and Perspectives


Boy/Girl?

As you’d expect from a sexual realm that once invited people to embody Shiva and Shakti during earthly intercourse, Tantra places significance on the union of male and female—so much so that some people find Tantric theory and practice a little too heterocentric for their taste. But if you are attracted to Tantra as an erotic practice, you need not emphasize the binary angle that Shiva and Shakti seem to represent. There are forms of Shiva that are depicted as hermaphroditic and represent the holy union of male and female energies in a single form. Additionally, the Tantra perspective understands gender as a fluid dance: Shiva and Shakti represent all the seeming opposites that exist inside each of us. Whether that is the masculine and the feminine, top and bottom, butch and femme, dominant and submissive, hard and soft, fast and slow, or yin and yang, there is something inherently exciting about the tension that arises in the play of polarities. After all, these practices have become detached from their original significance, and this didn’t just happen when they were introduced to the West in the early 20th century: Tantra has been morphing for way longer than that. Some queer sex theorists have embraced Tantra, and so can anyone.

One more thing about the “energy” we mentioned above: Tantric and other Hindu thought includes a concept about the way the body moves energy. Energy, or kundalini, circulates through the chakras; these are points along the spine and head that in Western terms correspond to important neural centers. In Tantric terms they may be associated mystically, not just with the way energy circulates and connects with the greater energy of the universe, but also with certain kinds of focus: sexuality, love, insight, and so on.



There are seven chakras:

	 The first (or root) chakra is at the base of the spine

The second chakra is at the sacrum

The third chakra is at the solar plexus

The fourth chakra is at the heart

The fifth chakra is at the throat

The sixth chakra is at the forehead

The seventh chakra is at the crown of the head





Each of these is associated with a significant nerve plexus, and some think they are also related to important glands in the body’s endocrine system. In Tantric thought they can be used to focus awareness or meditation.



Perhaps you know all about the chakras even if you’ve never had Tantric sex because you’ve practiced yoga. Some kinds of yoga focus on moving kundalini through the body, and some Tantric yoga practices (as well as kinds of yoga not associated with Tantra) focus on the concept of chakras.





Here are a few exercises derived from Tantra to get you started:


Eye gazing


The grandmother of all sacred sexuality practice, eye gazing can still the body and quiet the mind.

Look into each other’s left eye. This is said to open up receptivity, and keeps you from darting your gaze back and forth between the eyes. There is nothing else to do. Just gaze. Go ahead and blink—this is not a contest. Keep an attitude of receptivity and sacredness. This human being you gaze at is utterly unique, and is connected in every atom to the entire Universe.





Circular breathing


Inhale when your partner exhales. Stand or sit in a way that allows you to see your partner’s breath cycle, then synchronize accordingly. Slow way down; you can get lightheaded if you do this too quickly. Designate one partner as leader and one as follower, then switch. For the follower, imagine that this exchange allows you to drink deeply of your partner’s subtle body. For the leader, imagine yourself generously offering yourself to be consumed. Or imagine that you are cycling energy between yourselves, and that it is connecting you.





Hand on heart


Facing one another, each partner places their right hand on the other’s heart, then their left hands over the other person’s hand. Feel each others’ hearts beating; gaze into each others’ eyes; synchronize your breathing. Imagine energy moving in a circuit between you: eye to eye, following on the breath down to the heart, exhaled back out to the lover. This can be a peaceful, centering, and lovely exercise.





Externalizing the Inner Marriage (of Masculine and Feminine energies)


Playing sexually with polarities, such as man/woman, top/bottom, giver/receiver, etc., is a way of making conscious what is sometimes unconscious. Contemplate the polarities in your sex life with your partner. Choose one, and switch roles. Create a time limit and when you are done discuss how that affected not just your lovemaking, but your sense of self.





Yab Yum


Any time you connect sexually you can focus on the energy you share and exchange, but having intercourse in the Yab Yum position can be an especially powerful experience of this. This position allows great erotic focus as well as a way to readily add eye gazing, hand on heart and circular breathing to explicit sexual connection.

Possibly the most important practice of all is the letting go of goals. This is far easier said than done. A great starting place for modern lovers exploring Tantra together is to take a rigorous inventory of their expectations of sex, and experiment with letting those expectations go.

Get creative and create your own “Tantra Yoga.” Tantric attitudes and foundational principles encourage personal experimentation with all spiritual concepts. Tantra was born of the most outrageous iconoclasts you might imagine, who, as Tantrika Christina Sophie puts it, “had a penchant for flipping the bird to organized religion.” There are no shoulds or sacred rules. At the heart of Tantra is the injunction to “dare to grasp the means of your own realization.” If your intention is union with the divine, the Tantrics of old would happily bless whatever over-the-top idea you have to get there, particularly if it defies cultural convention. But if you basically use these techniques to slow down and focus on the present, becoming more deeply intimate with a special someone, you will become one of many who have learned to value Tantric sexual styles simply for the pleasure and connection they can bring.





Ecstasy Breathing


For many years Good Vibrations hosted educator Jwala and her workshops on Energy Orgasms or Ecstasy Breathing. Annie Sprinkle is a big fan of these energy orgasms; she studied with Jwala and now teaches them too. This isn’t a Tantric technique, per se, though it bears some resemblance to some Tantra breath practices.

If you’d like to try it:

	 Lie on your back wearing loose clothing (or none at all), knees raised.

Relax and quiet your mind; you may have experience doing this from practicing yoga or meditation. Breathe in and out deeply and let this help you relax further.

To begin breathe deeply in through your nose, then exhale through your mouth. “Circular breathing” means you don’t pause between inhale and exhale—do it this way, which builds energy faster.

Begin to rock your pelvis. Arch your back on the inhale and relax it on the exhale. Now add a PC muscle squeeze on the exhale.

Circular breathing and repetitive pelvis/PC muscle squeezes will build energy in your body. Not everyone experiences this as sexual, but if it does feel that way, go with it. In any case, concentrate on your chakras, one after the other. Remember that these are areas of the body with strong neurological activity; it doesn’t actually matter if you believe the chakras are “energy centers” to benefit from doing this.

Some teachers encourage you to visualize this energy so it’s easier to imagine it centering in different parts of your body. Think of it as a glowing ball or some other image that works for you.

You may find you want to make sounds, move your body more or clench your muscles, and all of these can be associated with full-bodied orgasm—a powerful sense of release. Imagine all that energy rushing out orgasmically, connecting you to the universe.

You can prolong this state by continuing the circular breathing and movement, but many people like to slow down to a resting state at this point and enjoy feeling “blissed out.”



Some people engage in Ecstasy Breathing solo, while some do it together during intercourse, connecting their bodies sexually even as they raise intense energy through breathing and movement. For easier learning, we recommend watching videos online to see others practicing energy orgasms. Lastly, Annie Sprinkle’s book Spectacular Sex has her description as well.





Long Distance Sex and Technology: It’s Not So Beta Anymore


	It’s Always All About the Tech


These days, with new must-have products and apps being developed right and left, plus sex toys that practically read your mind, it’s tempting to say that people’s sexual options are new, new, NEW! And it’s likely that the future of sex will be as technological as any other aspect of our lives. In fact, sex and tech seem so woven together now that perhaps we should say up front that the only thing not relevant to this chapter is old-fashioned skin on skin—and some people seem to regard this as a sort of backlash to the increasingly tech-y elements of sex.



So closely linked are sex and tech that CES (the International Consumer Electronics Show) and the Adult Video News Adult Entertainment Expo were held together in Las Vegas from 1984 through 2011. In 1998 they separated to the degree that two different badges were needed and they were held in two different rooms at the same location through 2011. In 2012 AVN moved the AEE to the Hard Rock Casino, held on a different date than CES, to the disappointment of many a tech guy.





But a technological invasion of sex is nothing new. As long as we’ve had modern technologies—and we’re not talking “21st century modern,” we mean the modern era launched with the Industrial Revolution—we’ve used them to jazz up and document our sex lives, convey sexual messages or find partners, and intimately connect us to others. No sooner had the camera been invented than it was used for naked photography; no sooner were moving pictures part of our world than they were deployed to shoot erotic films. Those are the antecedents of modern pornography—but also of the selfie and sexting. If there is anything really new under the sun, sex-wise, it might be how easy technology now makes it to connect, flirt, document your erotic experience, and even broadcast your exhibitionistic self to the world.





The Next Best Thing to Being There


Remember, the real reasons sex and tech go together like peanut butter and chocolate are that we humans want to be entertained, and we want to stay connected. Technology allows us to do both. Whether we’re on our lunch hour pining for our sweetie while we’re at work, in a different town, or halfway around the world, and whether we’re penning passionate love letters—with an actual pen—or video-chatting and showing off our sexy new underwear, humans in love and lust have long found ways to keep the fires burning, and light new fires, via technological communication. The phone company’s motto used to be “Long distance: the next best thing to being there,” but we bet that many people today would give that honor to the video-chat platforms, maybe with some teledildonics thrown in.

Let’s consider some of the ways we utilize tech for sex.





Talk to Text


We still sometimes do utilize that quintessential 20th century technology, the telephone, for phone sex—hearing a sexy voice over the line may be something that will never go out of style, though it’s now more likely to be a smartphone or mobile device than a landline. Phones are an ideal technology for learning to talk explicitly, and probably no more basic way to keep lovers linked together across town or great distances. Today, of course, we use phones for more than just talking: It’s all about IMing, sending pictures and dirty words. We can also use other mobile devices or computers to do these things. Instead of using the Pony Express to carry our love notes, we can rely on emails and instant messages, direct tweets, video chats, dating apps or chat rooms. You can now buy apps that make your phone vibrate—or you can use your phone as a remote control for your, or a lover’s, vibrator. Though these aren’t quite the same as whispering sweet nothings into a sweetheart’s ear.





Polaroid to Smartphones


People have been taking frisky photos since the invention of the camera; this business of taking naked pictures is hardly brand-new. There was a long era when it helped to have an at-home darkroom to develop your own smutty photo stock, because you didn’t want the folks at the lab to see those pictures. But then came the invention of the instant photograph, most notably the Polaroid. A camera that developed a picture instantly—well, fairly quickly, anyhow—it could be used for immediate gratification and for making precious erotic keepsakes. Swingers and others looking for sexy strangers might find each other in the personal ads, then mail Polaroids to each other to see if a meeting was desired by both parties. To keep it discreet, they’d use a post office box—not privacy software or a secret window.

That was then—though there was so much outcry when the Polaroid was discontinued that it was later revived. But now you don’t need a special camera to take those hot pics of yourself or each other—you probably have all the technology you need right on your phone.





Sexting


And that, of course, leads to the most notorious new word of the early 21st century: a libidinous mash-up of “sex” and “texting.” If talking trashy via the phone is the most basic way of staying sexually connected from afar, sexting may be the most irresistibly immediate. From sweet sexy nothings typed on a teeny keypad to cutesy emoticon illustrations to arty nudes to hardcore dick pics, that all-purpose friend in your pocket can deliver tiny-font, personalized smut and postage stamp-sized porno—anywhere, anytime. If you have enough battery power, that is.

Sexting’s immediacy is part of its charm, and perhaps also one of its chief risks. In the old days we had to check our impulse to pick up the phone when too drunk to think sensibly (well, to be honest, that still happens), but today, we’re one click away, maybe two, from publishing our private lives for all to see. It’s ironic that in an age when many tell-all sex bloggers write under pseudonyms, we have access to people’s private lives via text, social media websites and apps, and all the other places our weekend party pics wind up—whether we post them there or not. Read the fine print on all those platforms: Can your graphics be re-purposed? Are your privacy settings getting you actual privacy? And make sure the people whom you allow to see your cute butt selfie will keep that photo to themselves.

Do we sound prudish? Let’s just say that in the past, if a prospective boss were going to see a picture of your sexy self before offering you a job, it would likely be because your pissed-off ex mailed them some snapshots. Now, all they have to do is look online. There have been real problems associated with sexting: non-consensual sexting or use of private images; taking photos of people who are incapacitated; outing or slut-shaming via or because of these images, to name a few. Sexting by those who are under eighteen is legally considered child pornography if it involves nudity or explicit pictures. All these things happen with unsettling regularity, partly because there is insufficient discussion about consent and privacy issues before people get mixed up in such sexting fiascoes.

Look, this is the sweetest sex technology to come down the pike since computer-chipped vibrators. Let’s use it correctly.





Online Dating


You could find a date—or an anonymous trick, or a swinger party—in the old days via a classified ad in a special publication available only in an adult store. It’s one aspect of old-school “dirty bookstores” that made them so significant: They served as dissemination points for some of the only publications that allowed people to openly advertise for sex. For some people this wouldn’t be a necessity, but for those in alternative communities or with alternative sexual interests, it was sometimes a lifeline.

Now we just power up the laptop or check the battery on our cell phone and look for Mr./Ms. Right or Mr./Ms. Right-Now. Technology made paper-based classified ads essentially obsolete, replacing them with online posts: “somebody seeking somebody else”—which were replaced by dating websites or hookup apps for our phones. Online sex searches, partner-seeking, and everything in between is possible via computer. This is a hybrid phenomenon that required technology to mate with a significant change in social mores, since it is only within the last couple of decades that finding a partner via a classified ad, whether print or online, has become so acceptable that it raises few eyebrows. Whether you care more about someone’s politics or their perversions, online dating allows you to dial in compatible possibilities.

It’s not foolproof—you still need social skills and personal discernment when you get to your coffee date. Meet blind dates and strangers in a public place for the first time; get a good sense of them before you go over to their house to get tied up. Married folks looking for a secretive fling, predatory consent violators, and problem partners of every kind are among the many fish in the online dating sea. But you might meet all these in everyday life too, right? You can even find online friends who are absolutely not what they seem—people lie about their age, net worth, profession, schooling, and even gender online—but on the other hand, we can consider the online world a zone that supports fantasy and allows each of us to create new personas, inner selves finding a place to come out. So “lie” is a strong word to use; just be aware that this technology brings out the shapeshifter in many of us.

In fact, the people who may have the best experiences with online dating are those who belong to a specific interest group and use apps or websites precisely targeted to their type: Big Beautiful Women and their admirers, say, or people with particular sorts of BDSM desires. For “general-interest” dating, the Internet makes the pool extremely large, which can make for a lot of sifting to find your gem.





Live Chat & Computer Sex


Whether you enter an online space to meet potential partners or to lurk and listen—an electronic version of voyeurism—you may find erotic inspiration and even sexual community. And when you hook up online, the sex can easily stay online—if you’re geographically distant or don’t want, for some reason, face-to-face or skin-to-skin meetings with other people, you can still play with them. Some people concoct elaborate BDSM scenes with people they have not met in the flesh, reporting back to their dominant each time an instruction has been followed. Others do one-handed typing, having real solo sex as they virtually connect through chat, IMs, or emails. Others use sex toys with computer interfaces that allow one partner to remote-control the other’s toy from afar via Bluetooth or some other technological assist. For some, this kind of play feels less like cheating than meeting in person would—and if their partners agree with this assessment, they can forge ahead with no drama waiting in the wings; for others, it’s as much contact as they desire; and some would gladly turn these virtual fucks into embodied sex acts, but are separated from their online lover by geography or circumstance.





Online Porn


Many people turn to their little electronic friend for a basic form of sexual entertainment: Porn is all over the Internet, and it’s easy to get lost in a sexual wonderland when you log on. Not all of this explicit stuff is for everyone—though, as we note in our chapter on erotic media, there are so many kinds of sexual entertainment out there that seeing a little bit of porn and then decrying it is a bit like hating TV commercials but never watching the ones made for the Super Bowl. One person’s “Oh no!” is someone else’s “Oooh, lovely”—as we like to say in sex-positive education, “Don’t yuck my yum.”

Porn is made to erotically inspire, entertain—and, at times, amaze. Porn isn’t implicitly sex education or instruction, any more than car chases in movies teach us how to drive.

There’s plenty of free sexual material on the Internet, but sometimes it isn’t the kind you want to see. It used to be that you had to rent or buy adult movies you liked; now you can often watch them scene by scene. Good Vibrations made the leap to a pay-per-view platform so that anyone who doesn’t want to deal with storing discs or waiting for the mail delivery can get their movie with a few clicks. Differential prices let you view a scene, the whole movie, and even download the movie to keep.





Camming


Most sex movies are shot on digital or videotape, or even film, then streamed. There it is: Watch it or don’t, but don’t try to tell it what to do. Though some online erotic entertainment has been made to incorporate multiple perspectives or using videogame technology, and we wouldn’t be surprised if more of this becomes available in the future.

However, webcams make it possible to see your porn star live, in real time. Some cam stars don’t even make movies; they just log on regularly and do a show, sometimes responding to viewer requests and taking time to chat. Cam performers attract viewers who like to see “real people” do their thing, just as amateur sex movies do. Let’s be clear here: Porn performers are real people too—what did you think they were, automatons?­­—but they’re also doing a job, often hired for a particular look and directed toward a certain sexual style, and webcam enthusiasts either want a different style than this, or they get a real charge from the live-action element of the show, or both.

Webcams are a great asset for lovers as well. Video chatting websites and apps allow people to see each other from across the city, state, country, or world. These platforms get at least as much use for sex as for special Mothers Day chats and long-range business meetings; simultaneous chat programs take advantage of the fact that lots of laptops have built-in webcams, and newer smartphones let you do direct person-to-person camming as well. If you want to look your best for your sexy new friend or your long-time beloved, pay attention to lighting and background—“how to make your own porn” books and classes can help out here—and make sure you’ve got a robust wifi connection lest you suffer the technological equivalent of coitus interruptus.

Please note: Many of the computer-enabled technologies and software applications that can be used for getting close from afar come with licensing agreements, and more than a few of these contain restrictive language about sexual behavior and adult content. That’s right—some of the most innovative ways to feel the love require that we not get naked or do other “adult” activities. Many of the payment platforms we count on to get us close to our sexy purchases also contain this sort of language. Adult companies—including those that are well-behaved—have had trouble with their credit card companies’ restrictive lingo for years. What does this mean for you and sexy online fun? It might mean you could get booted off your favorite platform, that’s what. Write your service providers to complain.





Long-distance Sex Toys


Lovers have long incorporated toys into phone sex and instant camera snaps, and more recently into sext-y selfies and webcam shows, but the holy grail of toy-plus-tech is teledildonics…computer-enabled sexual experience, whether it’s live-action sex toys linked across miles by a computer program or the notorious suit that allows a person to be sexually stimulated on a whole-body level. No, it’s not available on the open market. This notion has been around the tech community for many years now and has yet to be fully realized, but there are app-controlled short-distance toys and Bluetooth/wifi-controlled toys already on the market—these can control a vibrator across any distance. Such technology comes in handy for long-distance love, makes hook-ups a little more interesting… and it’s the safest sex around. Connecting vibrators, dildos and penis sleeves in whatever configuration is appropriate for the people who want to use them for long-distance sex is an idea that’s finally getting there.

Even if you’re far apart, why stop with video-chat platforms and masturbation or erotic talk? Try out a toy together. Of course you could pull out the vibrator or penis sleeves you’ve already got in the drawer and save your money. But some people want to feel like someone else is controlling things, or that you’re really connected, if only through the magic of the Internet—if you resonate with that, there are long-distance toys for you. Research which apps are the least hackable to protect your own privacy, then—voilà—long-distance love!





Toy Tech… Into the Future


What next? The one thing we can predict is that existing designs and ideas will develop and improve as the technology that powers them improves: smaller and stronger power sources, better materials, new movement capabilities. We’re already seeing this in the world of sex toys. As we write this, one of these shifts has recently occurred: From simple to complex vibrations and wave patterns, we’ve added a style of toy with a magnet-enhanced ability to thrust, allowing the user to feel in-and-out movement.

Some people have always had a fascination with fucking machines and love dolls, which some time in the last generation morphed from a sort of person-shaped beach ball to lifelike Real Dolls made of silicone, bringing out one’s inner Barbie doll fan as much as one’s lustful side. Can the sexy androids of science fiction be far behind?

This isn’t our last word on the technological future. We’re saving the end of the book for a look forward into the 21st century; see if you agree with what we see in our crystal ball. And perhaps it goes without saying, but: Every book is a product of its historical moment. We can do our best to keep it updated, but by the time it falls into your hands, there may be technological sex options available that we just didn’t foresee. Please forgive any dark spots in our scrying glass, Oh Future Human, and we hope your excellent new technologies allow you to enjoy sex even more than we do today.





Enhancing Your Sex Life With Porn And Erotica


Watching erotic cinema is an easy way to add excitement to one’s sex life. Whether it’s watched alone or with others, it can provide stimulation, fodder for fantasies, and inspire new positions. Any sexually-oriented entertainment can be considered pornography, but this usually refers to explicit sexually-oriented entertainment, meaning that nudity and sexual acts are openly shown. For some, it’s controversial. For others, it’s arousing—and for still others it’s both at once. Sexologists consider it a form of erotology, a culture’s record of its sexual practices and preoccupations. And the erotology of our culture is hardly simple. Explicit sex can be embedded in a complicated plot, hardcore and intense, or sweetly romantic; it can be arty, loud, proud and queer. It can even be animated. There are so many flavors of sex movie, in fact, that anyone who describes pornography as just one thing exposes a lack of knowledge about a vast and diverse genre.

There are so many flavors of sex movie, in fact, that anyone who describes pornography as just one thing exposes a lack of knowledge about a vast and diverse genre.



Now, if watching others have explicit sex is not your cup of tea, that’s fine. We think it’s worth knowing more about these movies even so, for two reasons: There are so many generalizations about them made in the media and elsewhere that you’ll be more informed and less misled if you can get past the hype; and, more importantly, it’s possible that someone close to you—maybe very close—really digs watching films like these. So we offer up this chapter for people in these situations as well as all those curious about explicit adult movies.

Who’s watching? Adults of all ages and sexualities watch porn alone, as couples, or in groups of friends, who might throw on a sexy movie for special occasions—from landmark birthdays to engagements.





How to Watch Sexy Movies


Weeding to Find the Roses: Let Us Be Your Gardener


If you go online you’ll find endless choices of adult, explicit clips or movies. It’s common to stumble across something you’re not interested in or find outright offensive, regardless of your sexual identity or gender—it’s hardly all high art, and sometimes it can push our buttons. The adult industry has created some videos with objectionable tone and offensive content, at least to some consumers. It’s completely OK to want to avoid watching things that aren’t compatible with your own values around sexuality.

There are as many categories of adult movies as in mainstream films. How do you figure out if you’re going to like a movie when you’ve never seen that title? The trick is learning about the actors, directors and production companies. Each has a distinct style, sexual focus, and creative approach. As we enumerate these elements, bear in mind that adult movies don’t have big Hollywood budgets, so take that into consideration.

The saying, “If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen ’em all” does not apply when it comes to adult films. Our educating colleague Andy Duran makes the point this way: “I don’t like Tarantino movies, and I never watch them anymore. But it would be crazy if the first movie I saw was a Tarantino flick and I said, ‘That’s it, I hate this—no more movies for me!’ So if you don’t like one adult film, I would definitely try a different director or genre.”

As you watch movies in different categories, you will begin to notice the subtle differences that can shift the overall tone of the film, from lighting and music, or lack thereof, to the way the actors relate to each other. The simple motion of eye contact during a scene, or conversations leading up to the sex—not to mention the content of the sex itself—can be enough to affect how we feel about the chemistry and intentionality of the film. Plot and characterization and the performers’ acting chops make a big difference too.

By the way, if you’re tempted to scoff when we talk about elements like plot, script, acting, lighting, and music—many of the mainstay elements of every type of cinema—you may think we’re wildly overstating the case for porn as a cinematic genre. In fact, there are talented people making porn, and the movies they make are very, very different from “all sex, all the time” compilations. Not that there’s anything wrong with watching a whole bunch of sex—sometimes that’s just what we’re in the mood to see.

When someone who is unfamiliar with porn asks us what they should watch, we may reply, “What are you in the mood for?” Often their response is something like, “I dunno, something with normal sex.” Since “normal” is relative, we often follow that up with, “What would you prefer not to see?” This is when we get somewhere in learning what might be of interest to them. They may say that “normal” to them means “no anal,” but to the next person it means “no zombie plots!”

Sometimes it’s the one scene that makes the hard-on. Many people are aroused by watching anyone naked having sex. Perhaps it’s in our DNA. However, some folks want something that’s extra titillating, perhaps uniquely to them.





Should I Share the Fun? Watching Porn Together


Plenty of couples watch sexy movies together. They do it to get turned on, to get new ideas for fantasy play or erotic talk, to show each other what they find appealing, and sometimes just for kinky entertainment. We mean couples of all sorts—LGBTQQ and heterosexual, vanilla and kinky, college-age and retirement-age. For anyone along this range, adult cinema is a kind of sex toy in that it’s an addition or inspiration to erotic experience for spicing up date night.

There are many great reasons for watching erotic movies together: Higher arousal leads to better orgasms, and porn can lead to arousal. Sexy films create fodder for fantasies you can enjoy later. They can also provide inspiration for trying new positions or other kinds of spiced-up play. Although we’ve explained that porn is not primarily a sex education medium, countless people use it to get ideas. Try these positions and practices out within reason, keeping in mind that most of us have the bodies of ordinary humans, not flexible sexual athletes. If there’s a position you haven’t tried but are intrigued by, chances are there’s an adult performer who has, so why not investigate?





Get Your Tongues Going


	 In this case, we mean by talking. Discussions of what you like, dislike, and want to try can be sparked by watching sex films. They can help with communication between partners by generating conversations that can bolster a good relationship. Some good laughs might ensue, and then there are sexy comparisons to make: “Wow, that’s hot, huh?” It’s important to honor the notion that you might not try any of the positions seen on screen, but it’s still fun to get turned on watching them together. Then have any kind of sex you want to. Think about it: Millions of people hit the box office to watch horror movies—they love screaming, feeling their hearts racing, clutching a date or friend—yet how many of us really want a possessed demon coming at us out of the wall? Yet people love, and pay to see, horror movies for excitement and amusement. Bottom line: It’s fun to be entertained with someone else; it’s human nature.

A common first instinct when you sit down with your honey and a bowl of popcorn to view a blue movie might be giggling or even making fun of the on-screen proceedings—we understand the nervous giggles, but try to rein in at least the latter response so your partner won’t feel censored and too pre-judged to comfortably share their thoughts. It deepens your intimacy to share your responses to what you’re watching. You get to know each other more deeply, you dispel myths about sexuality— “No, I wouldn’t want you to come on my back! Whatever gave you that idea?” In the moment, you can say, “Wow, would you ever want to try that?” or “Just don’t ever ask me to do that!”

You don’t even need to watch together, in the same room at the same time, for this to happen. Instead of secretively burying your cache so your partner can’t track your online wanderings, talk about it. Tell each other what you’ve seen and discuss it. Maybe these talks never get to the point of erotic sharing—maybe they’re simply a way for one partner to say to the other, “No, that really doesn’t express my idea of pleasurable sex at all. What I like is…”

No matter how you choose to view porn videos, if you want them to they can spark changes—hopefully positive—in the level of your communication and sexual relationship.





Genres & Categories


Sex Ed


We’ve said that porn is not sex ed, and now we’ll revise that statement by adding “except when it is.” Sex educators have made explicit movies, and adult performers have put on their sex educator hats, to bring you moving pictures with the intent of teaching sexual skills. Many sex education films cover the same topics, so you can learn about intercourse positions, oral sex, anal or G-spots or what-have-you from more than one perspective. You can watch them all, or learn which director or educator’s work best suits your style.





Classics


The era of classic adult films is often referred to as the Golden Age of Porn. At the time—the 1970s through roughly the mid-1980s—those in the adult industry believed that porn was going to become as legitimate as mainstream film, so they often took cinematic production seriously. This was a time when movies were being busted left and right, so there’s a raw and edgy aspect to some of these films. Many showcased women’s empowerment and sexual liberation, not to mention natural bodies, witty dialog and entertaining plots. These films are mostly pre-HIV, so they were pre-condom. They were designed to be seen on the big screen, so the camera shots may often seem different from those in modern adult movies. Sex isn’t always as graphically shown in all of them as we’re accustomed to seeing today, though there are certainly exceptions that feature genital close-ups. This can be great for those looking for less hardcore imagery in film. For others, it’s the script and the acting that elevates these classics. Some titles include: The Opening of Misty Beethoven, Behind the Green Door, Insatiable, Deep Throat, Café Flesh, The Dancers, Talk Dirty to Me, and Outlaw Ladies.





Female Directed / Female Focused


These are not always one and the same, since many mainstream female adult stars also run companies. Jenna Jameson, for example, may direct a film, but at a glance it will look more like a typical adult movie than a feminist piece. Some women-made films, then, are not what people might imagine “female-directed” porn will be. Of course, the idea of female-focused is based on a stereotype of what women want (or even what a “woman” is), and while some women do want more romance, relationship, or a softer focus, others desire a more fierce depiction of female sexuality.

Female-focused films are often directed by men with the intention of appealing to the female market. They focus on male beauty and their notion of female fantasies. Some are narrated by a woman, so it can feel a bit like reading erotica or a book on tape. Many films from this section will show “traditional” sex positions, but with a softer touch: moaning vs. screaming, embracing vs. grabbing, no ejaculation on the face, more intimacy built into the plot. These films can be great for couples new to viewing adult movies together.





Features


Feature films are movies with a storyline or plot. Most Golden Age titles are features, but there are many contemporary ones as well. Just as there are many different types of mainstream films, in this category we have styles that include spoofs, thriller/horror, comedy, rom-com, and action/adventure. The adult cinema houses that produce these films tend to have higher budgets and production values, though not as much as a Hollywood production. They may seem to some viewers like a non-adult movie with sex; keep in mind that some modern porn actors may not be skilled in actual acting, while others do have the chops. Some of these films are in such high demand that you can find R-rated versions of them, minus the sex.





Parody


If you like any movie or TV series, from The Big Lebowski to Batman, there just might be an XXX parody of it!





All Sex / No Plot


Movies replete with sex and devoid of plot are often what people think of when they hear the word “pornography.” It’s self-explanatory: no plots to follow, just sex, sometimes as soon as the credits and FBI warnings start. Many performers in this genre are not big stars, although big stars are often featured in All Sex No Plot films. Though there are no plots, some may have a theme: fellatio, all women cast, pegging (where the woman penetrates the man), schoolgirl fetish, uniforms, etc. There tend to be a lot of vocals, mostly screaming and swearing, and “harder” sex. Many times you won’t see the male star’s face because the focus remains on the female performer’s body and the man’s cock—this is called POV, or Point Of View, and is meant to allow a male viewer to imagine himself right there in the scene. This type of porn is hot for many people and “too much” for others.





Fetish / BDSM


Because of obscenity prosecutions, it’s difficult to show both BDSM and sex in adult movies. Often you’ll find films showcasing BDSM play like bondage, flogging, and piercing, but no explicit “sex,” meaning no oral, anal, vaginal. Reputable studios tend to feature performers who are vocal about their work experiences; some porn stars in the public eye frequently find opportunities to discuss their work openly. Some BDSM performers are very much into this kind of erotic play in their “real lives.”





Girl on Girl


People often ask, “What’s the difference between girl-on-girl and lesbian movies?” G/G is a porn industry term. Any two women can be in a girl-on-girl scene even if they don’t have sex with women outside of work. Of course, we can’t know the actual sexual orientation of all actors, but dyke/lesbian films want their audience to know that the actors are in fact queer women. Lots of people, including many lesbians, enjoy G/G films, even though they tend to be designed primarily for male pleasure. The actors tend to be consistently feminine in appearance, but this doesn’t mean that G/G films should be considered femme. Lots of dyke/lesbian actors are femme and insist on not being seen as straight or “gay for pay.”





Queer


Sexual orientation and gender identities are diverse and can be fluid. Queer films showcase this with a wide range of sexualities and body types in all of their wonderful combinations. LGBTQQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer & questioning) videos are combined under the umbrella term Queer. With the rise of these films, and trans/genderqueer actors fluidly performing in different pairings, it has become even harder to categorize these films. For example, if a film has mostly dykes together and a scene with an FTM star, which section does it belong in: straight? lesbian? trans? The Queer category is the easiest way to help customers understand these films. Queer films often blur the lines of orientation and gender, and are often sexual and political, edgy, and inventive. Often Queer films are not like mainstream adult-industry representations as far as bodies and styles of sex are concerned.





Couples’ Porn


Conceived for couples to watch together, often featuring milder sex and a focus on relationships, these are a common place for people to start watching erotica, especially when one partner wants to introduce another to the pleasures of viewing sexy films.





Porn FAQs


What’s the Difference Between Porn and Erotica? Or Simply “Art”?


You might hear that some sex movies are considered erotica or art, while others are porn—nasty, dirty porn. The presumption is that you will agree that the first type celebrates sex and aesthetic beauty, while the second is low-class and problematic at best. But we know that people celebrate sex in all kinds of ways, and may see very different kinds of images as aesthetically beautiful. Sexual cinema reflects the priorities of the people who make it or their own notions about what their customers want to see. Some adult movie directors and performers are ambitious in what they want to depict, with the result that, at its best, porn does what all the best cultural products do: tells a story, opens our minds to perspectives and situations we hadn’t considered, gives performers challenging and engaging roles, and entertains as it enlightens.

Not all sex movies reach that bar, of course. But pornography, even when it’s poorly lit and kind of schlocky, is more than just sexual entertainment—it’s a way for people to explore ideas, see what sex and genitals look like, at least the porn version, and get into conversations about sex. This can happen in your own head, with a friend or partner, in a university classroom, or in groups over a beer.





Will I or my lover get addicted to porn?


This is a divisive subject even among professionals who are highly informed on either side.

We’re not saying you can’t watch too much porn; Carol confesses, “I play too much Solitaire on my cellphone, so I’m sure if I were watching the same amount of smut, the time-wasting effect would be comparable.” It’s possible to get so focused on any activity—sexual or otherwise—that one behaves compulsively about it. Whether you are talking compulsion or addiction, this can certainly be problematic for some. Surfing the world of sex online instead of getting to work on time? Problem! So you may want to be aware of unchecked compulsive behavior, which is a real issue at the bottom of this particular argument about erotic movies and pictures.

And when someone scopes the Web and downloads sexy movies instead of romancing their partner that can be a problem too, especially if those partners haven’t talked and agreed about the role of porn (or, for that matter, Solitaire) in their pairing. It can be easy to fall into a relationship with sexual entertainment and your own trusty hand if things are complicated or challenging in a marriage or other form of coupledom; it’s not necessarily the porn that’s at fault here, but such couples would do well to see a counselor to learn some communication and prioritization skills. If you’re part of a couple, your time and attention are a resource your partner expects to share, and if you are stingy with it for reasons of solo entertainment or anything else, it is likely to become an issue.

Some people don’t like the idea of their partner watching porn because it might lead to masturbation, and they think all sexual activity in their partnership should be between them. No solo time! Watching adult movies together could actually deflect a partner from masturbating, especially if you start having sex together after you push “play.” Also, don’t forget that masturbating together counts. And of course you know by now that we think masturbation is everyone’s birthright, not some sort of autoerotic adultery. We hope you’ll consider changing your anti-solo-sex ideas, if you still have any.





Aren’t the performers faking it?


Oh yes, these movies are “fake”—by definition, aren’t all movies, including that awesome science fiction movie and even that sweet romantic comedy? The so-called reality shows are very much not reality. Even documentaries are made, that is, the content is selected, edited and refined. It’s entertainment, so either skip it or enjoy.





Will my lover compare my body to the porn star’s?


The unsaid second half of that question is: and think I look bad by comparison?

No way. Both of you will most likely get turned on and just want to have sex—with each other—the real humans that are in the flesh in their sexy real-life arms.





Porn is Not Sex Ed


One thing we do not recommend you do with porn is use it as your primary form of sex education. Why? For starters, because we don’t want you to judge yourself or your partner’s abilities against sex professionals performing for a camera. Their angles, their positions, where they place their hands, mouths, and other body parts, where they come—outside of the body—all is done with the camera in mind. Conversely, there’s a lot you don’t see that’s done off-camera. These movies and pictures are made to entertain and arouse, rarely with the specific intention to inform, which means that the process of shooting and editing a sexually explicit movie makes many things about it unrealistic. Not fake, exactly—generally porn sex is real, but it’s also scripted, timed, and positioned in such a way that you don’t see sex the way the performers would do it at home for fun, or to genuinely please their lover. Nine times out of ten you don’t see them using lubricant, even for anal intercourse; the performers are stopping and starting, shooting one scene over and over for different camera angles or to get their lines right; ejaculation frequently happens outside the body; and positions are subtly or radically skewed so a camera can get up in their not-so-private parts. Performers in explicit movies are actors, and they are also, in a way, athletes, who’ve learned stamina, unusual body postures, and the ability to deal with physical intensity.

Trying to learn timing, moves and specific sex acts from this, with no other source of information about it, is a mistake, because porn does not simply document sex—it constructs it. Compare it to a car chase movie, which is also a highly-specialized spectacle meant to entertain. You may find the car movie thrilling and adrenaline-pumping or scary and off-putting, but no matter what, it would be a mistake to watch it to learn how to drive—much less drive your everyday car. Put another way, we’ve encouraged you toward media literacy when you’re reading about sex on the Internet or in popular magazines—remember that somebody wrote all that, and maybe they have an agenda, or maybe they didn’t do the best research. Porn is a media product. Consume it—like everything else—with at least one eye open, no matter where you have your hands while you’re doing it.





Feminist Porn


There’s a new wave of feminism, and one of the ripples in that wave is called feminist porn. In the mainstream world some folks have heard about this—maybe while searching for porn they might like—while others haven’t heard about this movement at all. Many people think the words “feminist” and “pornography” can’t possibly go together in a sentence, unless the words “are against” come in between. But this just isn’t true: Some feminists don’t like porn; other feminists make porn; plenty of feminists love and watch porn. But women, and everybody else with egalitarian gender sensibilities, tend to be put off by explicit movies that amplify problematic gender roles or even eroticize them, or that seem to presume men are the only possible viewing audience. Also problematic are films in which the female performers don’t look like they’re enjoying themselves or, worse, seem to be detached, high, or unhappy. While any performer might be able to act happy even if they’re not engaged, we want the filmmakers to care about presenting women as sexually empowered or satisfied and making sure their on-set experience is as positive and empowering as it can be.

Depending on who you ask, “feminist porn” could be: sex movies made by or starring feminists; intending to depict women’s sexuality in an authentic and pleasure-focused way; showing alternative sexual practices like pegging—where the woman penetrates the man; or featuring performers who co-create the sex scene and choose the partners they want to work with and the kind of sex they want to have. Feminist ideas—which mean many things to many people—can also be part of the plot in an adult movie. These films can be anything from romantic to arty to fiercely hardcore.

In fact, while feminism and pornography are by no means always a peanut butter-and-chocolate blend, they come together in the anthology The Feminist Porn Book. The annual Feminist Porn Conference explores erotic media from a feminist perspective, and an academic journal launched to study porn is edited by women and has a significant feminist porn component. There’s an award show especially for these films, the Feminist Porn Awards, launched by Good For Her in Toronto. Its website offers a great list of movies—all its winners since it began in 2006. These awards recognize movies, short and feature-length, from all over the world, exploring all kinds of sex, made by a wide array of artists—not to mention giving love to new or breakout performers who represent sex in a charismatic, diverse and authentic way. As the Awards demonstrate, there’s also a significant overlap between feminist porn and queer porn.

Feminist porn has developed a roster of key players, from directors to actors to the academics who analyze and write about it. The moniker “feminist pornographer” may have first been used to refer to Candida Royalle, who started Femme Productions in 1984, though she does not necessarily embrace this as her primary filmmaking identity; she would rather be known for “couple’s porn” or erotic films. In 1983 five New York City-based porn stars—Royalle, Annie Sprinkle, Veronica Hart, Veronica Vera, and Gloria Leonard—launched a support group (and enduring sisterhood) called Club 90 which helped make them all household names among fans, and other creators, of feminist porn. On Our Backs magazine—“Entertainment for the Adventurous Lesbian”—was founded in the 1980s with a mission to bring sex-positive feminist porn to those who wanted it, and its photo sets gave many queer and feminist photographers a chance to develop their erotic work; they also made movies. Three names closely associated with OOB are also among the most important foremothers of lesbian, queer, and feminist porn: Debi Sundahl and Nan Kinney created Fatale Media, one of the very first companies to make erotic movies for women who loved women, and OOB editor Susie Bright toured her influential, informative, and entertaining clip show “How to Read a Dirty Movie” all over North America. For many feminists, Susie’s was the first voice that gave permission and support for liking erotic images.

Tristan Taormino is a theorist of feminist porn and has produced many films in this small but significant genre. She launched the Feminist Porn Conference in Toronto in 2013, bringing together many of the academics who study porn together with the feminist porn activists and moviemakers who create the work they analyze. She’s also one of four editors of The Feminist Porn Book; the others, Constance Penley, Mireille Miller-Young, and Celine Parreñas Shimizu, are academics at the University of California-Santa Barbara, where Film and Media Studies professor Dr. Penley has taught the world’s longest-running course on Porn Studies.

“I’ve been teaching a course on pornography at UC Santa Barbara since 1993,” Penley told us. “In trying to find out how others had done it, I looked for but couldn’t find any other courses entirely devoted to pornography. I discovered that a professor might teach one porn film in a large Human Sexuality course, maybe even bringing in a speaker from the industry. Or a professor would include one film in a graduate seminar on representation and sexual difference. Women’s studies courses would show, if anything, an anti-porn documentary, but not a porn film itself. I contacted the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality to get help putting together a teaching collection. Their president Ted McIlvenna was so happy that someone was going to devote an entire course to pornography and that I would be doing it as a regular film studies class. He helped me amass a substantial teaching collection. So I’m not the first professor to teach pornography, but I’m the first to teach it as film and popular culture, as a genre and an industry. I don’t start by asking whether it is art or not, deviance or not, but what is it as a form of media that can be studied with the theories and methods that one would take to any other instance of media culture and technology.” Penley was also the first to include a full range of guest lecturers from every part of the industry—mainstream adult, alt, queer, amateur, feminist, and more—as well as industry trade journal publishers, adult industry trade organization officials, novelty manufacturers, attorneys, sex educators, and sex activists. Her insight that few if any academics were embedding the study of sex movies within the context of popular culture, or looking at many movies as a range instead of just a few, helps us understand how important it is not to think of erotic movies in just one way.

Tristan Taormino has similarly pioneered, but within the mainstream industry as well as within the feminist subgenre. “For me,” says Taormino, feminist porn is “about creating a working environment that is respectful, consensual, fair, with good working conditions, and where the experience of sex as sex work is a positive one. I’m interested in the performers participating in creating their own images, and their own representation. I want to find out what they like, what they don’t like, what toys they want to use, what positions, what performers they want to work with, and what they’re interested in sharing with the camera. I think it’s important that they have a voice.” This would be a good basic definition of “ethical porn,” a movement that also has very significant overlap with the feminist variety.

In a recent Feminist Porn Awards speech Taormino compared feminist porn to the organic food movement. This is a parallel that’s easy to understand: I like it spicy, you like it mild. I like cilantro, you think it tastes like soap. Different diners want to chow down on different things, and go to varying extremes to control what they eat to make sure their daily bread is healthful and produced sustainably.

Another porn producer, Jackie Strano of the groundbreaking SIR Productions, defines feminist porn as “when the partner getting penetrated has a fully embodied orgasm and experiences intense pleasure onscreen in a non-traditional/non-formulaic way. It usually showcases diversity in performers with all gender, ethnicities, and sexual orientations included and portrays sex in a way that is focused on authentic, raw, and sometimes more intimate sex.”

Feminist Porn: Why should you care? It is, of course, up to you whether you “eat organically,” porn-wise, or greet junk food with a lusty appetite. Different strokes, and sex movies, for different folks, after all. But many people are concerned with the wellbeing of the performers who make the adult films they consume, so it’s good to know that some filmmakers and performers take these issues seriously. The performers in particular value not only the opportunity for greater control over their experience, but the fact that their performance can counteract the popular notion that no one would make sex movies of their own free will. Many people like explicit cinema and consider it an integral part of their sex lives, and feminist porn seeks to make the experience something that everyone—except maybe the “No naked pictures! Ever!” people—can feel good about.





Making Your Own Sexy Movies


It’s our opinion that if you decide to make your own explicit movie you should do so wishing, wanting and knowing you’re creating it to share—anyone might see it, and you need to acknowledge that to yourself. Homemade porn and in-home bedroom webcams are now a big part of the American economy. If your life would be in ruins if someone found your private sex movie, don’t make one. There’s no guarantee that someone unintended will never lay eyes on it.

Still want to do it? Here are some tips:

Decide whether you will use a pseudonym. It’s easy to switch to your real name if you choose to later, but it’s hard to put your real name back under the pillow once it’s been revealed. Even porn-proud people sometimes choose a pseudonym to keep their worlds separate in our easily-searched and endlessly-Google-able universe. Maybe you have a vegan recipe website in addition to your foot fetish blog. The same person might be a fan of both sites, or maybe not. You can be open or not with your names. Sometimes this can even lead to extra exposure, so to speak. “Like my vegan slow-cooker stew? Want to see me make it in bare feet? Click here!”

What do you love to do? One of the things most people on earth dream about is finding a job—and getting paid for—doing what they love. It’s a rare luxury. So make a list of what you love to do sex-wise. Include all sensual and sexy options, including BDSM if you love it. You might decide not to choose to reveal something intimate, vulnerable or special to you. You might leave that for only you and intimate partners. On the other hand, maybe your favorite thing in private becomes your favorite thing on camera.

How are you going to get people to see it? Sites all over the Internet are looking for content. You decide which to use after researching them. The whole point of DIY porn is that you get paid because you make and sell your content yourself. If it’s a pay per click site, check up on them—do others get paid in a timely fashion? Do you like the feel of the site in general, and would you be happy to be part of that “family”?

Quality production tips: Create the best lighting you can afford without breaking the bank, enjoy yourself and be sure that other performers enjoy themselves, too; take some gorgeous still photos to pull in viewers, take care of your health and body, and select the best streaming options so people can actually see what you create.

Don’t be shy about contacting blog or press writers to tell them what you have been up to. Doing shady links never works. For example, some people put spam links into the comment sections of blogs. More and more of these bogus comments are getting caught; doing it will just cause writers to delete and discount you. Instead, introduce yourself and be up front, honest and passionate. Tell them your specialty. Use social media but do so honestly—surely there’s enough content out there for you to genuinely “like” and comment on topics and photos that will make people notice you and your work. Find your niche, find your people, find your audience—let others know you exist and they will find you.

We do not recommend making a sexy movie or series of pictures for your newfound love of twenty-four hours—or your husband of twenty-four years, for that matter. It’s so easy for someone to post your image as “revenge porn”—common enough that it’s been a topic of legislation. Even if you and your partner/s are completely trustworthy, someone could steal or find your phone/camera/emails/etc. It happened to Pam and Tommy Lee! If it would be the end of the world to have your image online, consider pursuing your exhibitionistic streak in a less permanent way. Don’t make solo explicit material for someone else, even if they ask you to, unless you really want to do it. We’re not saying it’s always a bad experience; we’re saying you ought to think about it first and be sure this is the kind of Valentine you want to give your lover. Remember, the Internet is forever. If you aren’t concerned about your explicit images getting into the wrong hands, then go for it. If you’re not okay with that, here’s our suggestion: give your love a fabulous vibe-of-choice, put them in a comfy spot, tell them to sit back and enjoy a live show of you right there in front of them. Most people have varying degrees of “not OK”—for some this would be the end of the world, while for others it would be upsetting but then turn into the family joke. Oh, and wait until you’re over eighteen before getting in front of a camera naked. Even if someone under eighteen consents to make such images, they are illegal.





Crawl Into Bed With a Good Book


A Little Literary History


While we’re sure erotica was available to a select few before the advent of the printing press, once multiple copies of written work became possible, sexually explicit writing took its place next to the other literary works published prior to and during the Age of Reason. Classic works of erotica include the explicitly illustrated I Modi (1524), L’École des Filles or The Girls’ School (1655)—apparently this volume got Samuel Pepys hot—John Cleland’s Fanny Hill (1748), the late 18th century works of de Sade, and Victorian blockbusters Autobiography of a Flea and The Pearl. While suppression of these works remained a fact of life for publishers and writers well into the 20th century, the impulse to produce libertine literature was stronger than the censors. Great writers set their hand to it, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Georges Bataille, Henry Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, Alexander Trocci, and Marco Vassi.

Good Vibrations has always had a soft spot for erotic writing. In the 1980s we launched The Erotic Reading Circle, where writers could read their own new work and fans could pull a book from the shelves and share their favorite story. (The Circle moved over to the Center for Sex & Culture in the early 2000s.) We carried erotica from the very beginning, particularly that written by women, a genre that was just beginning to flower. Though Story of O by Pauline Réage, a pseudonym of French journalist Anne Desclos, had been in print since the 1950s—she wrote it when her older lover Jean Paulhan claimed a woman couldn’t write a good erotic novel—it wasn’t until the 1970s that novelist and acclaimed diarist Anaïs Nin’s erotic stories from the 1940s were collected in two volumes, Delta of Venus and Little Birds. Diane di Prima’s Memoirs of a Beatnik had been published in 1969. Women’s erotic stories, memoirs, and novels would get more and more attention from then on, from anthologies like A Woman’s Touch, The Ladies’ Own Erotica books, and the Herotica series. The latter were edited by our own Joani Blank, Susie Bright, and Marcy Sheiner (published by Good Vibrations’ publishing arm, Down There Press).

By the 1990s, a heyday of sexual literature, terrific erotic writing could be found in ‘zines and journals like Taste of Latex and Libido as well as anthologies published by small presses like Richard Kasak Books, Circlet Press, and Cleis Press. Notably, these homes for erotic writing often included stories from across the sexuality spectrum, though of course it was possible to find books and magazines that were focused only on lesbian, or gay, or heterosexual, or BDSM, themes. Susie Bright began publishing annual Best American Erotica anthologies, and Cleis Press later followed with Best Lesbian Erotica, Best Gay Men’s Erotica, Best Women’s Erotica, and more. By the end of that decade erotic writing began to move online—books were digitized, websites like the one organized by the Erotica Readers & Writers’ Association launched to offer an electronic home for sexy stories—and eager readers flocked online, not just into bookstores, to have their fancies and nether parts tickled by fantasies, from sweet and light to extreme, put into words.

This brief account is obviously limited, with very little of the global surface scratched; erotica has a long and multicultural history. If its literary manifestations are too highbrow for your liking, you’ll be glad that there is still plenty of smut, dirty books, trashy novels, and one-handed reading—not to mention “the good parts” of more mainstream works—to enjoy. Erotica and Erotic Romance busted into the mainstream thanks to technology which levels the playing field and creates instant and wide access to a hungry consumer population for titillating story telling. 50 Shades of Grey was called Mommy Porn and it opened up the desire to read sexy pages to some folks who hadn’t done so in the past. Regardless of our concerns about the book’s content and consent, we’re always happy for the erotic doors of possibility to be opened! More books to be read—and you can read them in almost any format you desire, on a multitude of device and for a wide range of prices. It’s all up to you to find your favorites. Whether you consume the ink-on-paper version or the bits-and-bytes kind, please make room on your reading list for sex! (See some of our suggestions here.)





Listening to Erotic Books Is A Best Seller!


by Shar Rednour

Susie Bright is an audio book maven, the “go-to gal” to hear the latest on anything audio—sex, pop culture, history, music, literature and audio books and podcasts. As the author of eleven books and editor of more than eight anthologies (each with many volumes), she had an entire career before she became the savvy audio personality, producer and editor she is today. Like millions of Americans, I too listen to audio books and podcasts all the time. When I asked her to tell me more about the explosion of erotica and romance in audio she told me this:


Erotic authors, Romance authors, independent writers of all kinds, were kept out of the audiobook industry for decades—in part because of economics, but beyond that, because of bias. Audible was the first audio publisher and distributor to embrace erotic literature without discrimination.

In the days of tape cassettes and CDs, audiobooks of any sort were expensive to create, with high retail prices and small royalties for authors. The only markets that succeeded were “airport bestsellers” and large niche recording markets, like Children’s. The audiobook library was narrow and shallow compared to print.

Furthermore, there was a prejudice against Romantic and Erotica writers. The audio publishers at the time would make objections like, “What if someone gets out of control listening to this erotica and crashes their car!” Yes, they really said that to me. But they never said that about a bestselling Stephen King horror novel that would really make you scream!

The big iceberg broke with my bestselling series, The Best American Erotica series, all 15 volumes. Audible asked me to suggest other erotic literary fiction classics.

In 2012, I started working as an editor at large at Audible, where I could acquire evergreen erotic classics so I brought in Exhibitionism for the Shy, Richard LaBonte’s gay romance series, some good kinky S/M with Molly Weatherfield’s Carrie’s Story and Laura Antoniou’s Marketplace and more. The authors were thrilled. And, in what was probably the most commercially significant, I opened the door to erotic romance—the Ellora’s Cave collection, and many independent erotic romance writers. They instantly became audio bestsellers.



Thanks, Susie. The audiobook world is now open to every topic, persuasion, and publishing background, and both high- and low-brow erotica flourishes. The books are available on every mobile device or computer. You even get to listen to free samples before buying—which is the only tip needed to help you find your favorites. Enjoy!





Sexy Setbacks—

To Be Honest, I Don’t Want to Have Sex (or maybe I can’t)


Do any of the sentences below ring true for you?

“What if I just don’t want to have sex, or don’t feel sexual?”

“Am I kidding myself by even trying?”

“Why am I even reading this book?”

“Do I really have to have sex?”

“I confess, I bought this book because I’m worried that I’m so different from my friends.”

“I got this book because I’m trying to make my partner happy or save my relationship.”

“I’m worried because I used to like sex.”

“I do want to have a sex life, but I can’t.”



One of the confusing elements about sex is the mixed messages coming at us: on one hand, sex is awesome. Sexy sex! We want it all the time! It’s great! On the other hand, many of us were raised to feel ashamed about sex, warned of its perils, or have had bad experiences. It’s a dichotomy that has been called “pleasure vs. danger,” and it tends to obscure how much sexual variety exists, in desire and expression, between people and over the course of a person’s lifetime. We’ve talked a lot about variations in what people want; now we’ll look at whether people feel desire for sex—any kind of sex—at all; what affects desire; and what affects orgasm. We’ll address the problems that arise for folks who very much wish they could enjoy various sex acts but for whatever reasons are not able to do so.

It’s natural to want a lot of sex; it’s also natural not to want it, at least under some circumstances, and some people, of course, want only solo sex rather than sex with another person. Many things affect libido, interest, and desire, and there are many reasons that someone might avoid sex and/or not feel sexual. Before we get into them, let’s just acknowledge that you’re reading this book: We already know that you are interested in sex or in feeling sexual, or at least curious about it. But it’s possible to want to understand sex, or certain kinds of sex, without wanting to have those experiences. Sometimes people just don’t feel sexual or desire sexual contact with other people and may define themselves, actively and positively, as asexual. Others may choose periods of celibacy, sometimes extended periods—reasons for this decision may vary widely, from avoidance of STIs to healing after a bad romance to a focus on spiritual, educational, or other concerns. And lastly, some elements we’ll discuss in this section are not about choice at all.





Asexuality


The people who define themselves as asexual have, in recent years, begun to unite in community. Research is now being conducted about asexuality.

Asexuality is on the human sexuality spectrum in that it has to do with peoples’ identity, experiences, and feelings about sex. Many sexually active people give asexuals a hard time, though. Asexual folks are told they “haven’t met the right man/woman/person yet”; they are treated as though there’s something wrong with them; and people are confused if the asexual person does want to be in a partnership with someone else. Some asexuals define themselves as queer, because “queer” can encompass all the ways to be sexual besides the heteronormative “one man, one woman having sex that could make babies” standard that has been the primary way “normal” sex has been defined in the Western world.

One sometimes incorrect belief is that asexual folks have no sexual or intimate desire at all, ever, so that a person who masturbates, but doesn’t want partner sex, isn’t “really” asexual; others feel fine incorporating masturbation into their definition of asexuality. We’ve also met kinky asexuals who have no interest in genital sex play at all, but who like certain aspects of BDSM. As far as identity is concerned, it’s best to let a person define themselves.

And finally, we should state clearly that we do not include asexuality in this section because we consider it a problem or pathology. As long as a person is content with their sexual desires—or lack of them!—and can conduct themselves within an atmosphere of consent, it is surely not our place to try to exhort them into being more, or differently, sexual than they choose to be.





Lack of Interest in Your Dating Pool


Yep, that’s right, we said it. What if you really have not found the right person? Do we sound like your grandmother? The truth is, some people are not interested in the people around them. Sometimes we’re in too small a community to generate much zip among those people you’ve known all your life. Maybe the people who surround you just aren’t the ones who float your boat. For example, you might not feel sexy around the average feminine-looking woman, but then one day you meet a masculine woman, maybe someone who calls herself a “butch” or “stud,” and zing zing go your heartstrings—and other parts too! What if you could care less about a clean-shaven man, then you see a Paul Bunyan type and unexpectedly go crazy with lust? We know country trailer-dwellers who’ve moved to big-city condos to improve their love lives, and city slickers who left town and settled down in Cowboy Country for the same reason. If you skipped our sexual individual section, get thee back to it! These kinds of preferences are only a few of the countless ways different desires and identities affect our sexual options and responses.

Another factor besides geography that applies here is age. Some older people—men and women—aren’t attracted to people their age, and this isn’t just the “trophy wife” syndrome. Also, as we age we tend to pair off, so fewer partners are available to single elders. It’s also not uncommon to find that your “type”—the sort of person you find most attractive—remains fairly stable throughout your life and you used to be able to find them, but as you age the choices become more limited.

Luckily online dating and social media are helping people around the globe in all these departments.

We also know many people who—well, there’s no better way to say it—“made do with what they had.” That’s country talk for being flexible, adventurous and resourceful. “If you can’t be with the one you love, honey…” as the song Love the One You’re With reminds us. In Shar’s book The Femme’s Guide to the Universe she discusses this idea as it relates to bi and lesbian lovers, because she’s from a small town and has seen this dynamic in action. We know of some beautiful, strong, loving relationships between people who were not each other’s perfect person, but because they were open-minded and connected they stayed in love and enjoyed their life together. They discussed various things they thought, wanted to try, and enjoyed—oftentimes making themselves vulnerable in the revealing, and as we’ve said, vulnerability adds to intimacy—as long as it’s with a kind and honest person and not a jerk.

Some people do not want to mate at all. Some folks wish they could have a mate but don’t lose sleep over it. They don’t want to move, or to date online, or do a dance of negotiation or compromise. If you are that person, then our only advice is to be sure to create community and stay involved with the human race. Our hope for you is that you have good friends and family in your life so that as you age you will have help and companionship. You most likely already know this and are doing your best. In regards to this book and our ability to help you with sexual concerns let us say clearly: Partners are 100% not required for happiness, nor to have and enjoy absolutely fabulous sex.

If you do find that you lack interest in the people around you, know that other people in your shoes have maintained long-distance relationships that allow for occasional in-person connections and phone or online communication, or have traveled to bigger cities for sexual adventures, then go home to sit by the fire until it’s time to do it again.





I Can’t Find a Partner Who Wants Me


It’s one thing to have a dating pool that doesn’t interest you—it’s quite another to be so isolated from possible partners that you just can’t find anyone who wants you, no matter how many crushes on others you experience or friends and strangers you find attractive. It’s not necessarily a lifelong state, but if you feel lonely and desirous of a lover, we bet that our telling you that “someday your prince/ss will probably come” is cold comfort.

However, it’s important to wrap your mind around this, because if you are too preoccupied with partnering, it can actually get in the way of finding a comfortable connection with somebody else, or increase the likelihood that you will say yes to a partner who’s seriously wrong for you. Please check out our chapter on Finding Partners, especially the section called Lover’s Luck—we wrote it to help you evaluate whether you are getting in your own way when it comes to putting yourself out there as a partner.





Resentment in Your Relationship


Plenty of couples have stormy relationships, with huge fights and bouts of passionate make-up sex. While this can happen in a dysfunctional context, it’s also just the way some of us are wired, or learned from the ups and downs of our parents’ love. Learning to fight fairly, disagree, and tackle thorny issues is part of any couple’s challenge as they work toward their most satisfying form of intimacy. One version of disagreement that can poison the well of sexual desire, though, is simmering resentment.

This can emerge from any of the vicissitudes of coupledom—it doesn’t have to be about sex in the first place, though if one partner experiences the other as selfish or insensitive in bed, that’s a common seed from which resentment can grow, as is an un-healed-from experience of infidelity or dishonesty. Resentment can also be generated by disrespectful communication, plus disagreements of any kind that are not processed successfully: fights about money, time, family, the kids, or just about anything else. What about parenting? How many couples become parents thinking that they would never divorce but then end up in a sexless relationship with a mile-high wall of resentment? You absolutely must normalize the parenting experience and have a laugh about it or resentment may brew. Watch some of those parenthood movies, take the pressure off, then make a sexy and fun plan to tackle your intimate life.

In these situations, libido does not turn back on like flipping the bedroom light switch: The source of the resentment, and the tendency to hold onto it in the first place, must be addressed. Fortunately, therapists are well-versed in helping couples learn the skills they need to communicate more clearly, disagree more cleanly, and open up channels of respect and desire. Without a therapist to help with this situation the prognosis is not as good; many couples have been together for decades and have nursed these emotional wounds and resentments for almost that long. In spite of what your friends experience or the example you saw in your family, it doesn’t have to be that way.





Pass The Remote—Or, Wake Me Up When You’re Ready


Many couples bear each other no resentment or irritation, but neither can they get their groove back. This is a common situation that can affect people of any gender or sexual orientation; sex therapists say some couples fall into a rut within three years of getting together. The “Seven Year Itch” is usually thought of as an urge away from monogamy, but sometimes the itch is a response to the feeling that sex with your partner is the same, will always be the same, and the things that attracted you to each other in the first place have lost their luster. This isn’t about falling out of love, but rather out of lust, and sex therapists frequently challenge couples in this situation to add new erotic practices and situations to the mix—out of the rut, which is its own kind of comfort zone, partners can look for new aspects of each other for turn-ons.





Lack of Sleep


Stress affects libido and desire, and one source of stress is sleep—or rather the lack of it. The lack of sleep actually causes stress reactions in our bodies. And to make matters worse, sleep problems are often caused by stress—although there are several reasons we might not get enough rest. According to the National Sleep Foundation, more than 40 million Americans don’t get enough sleep, often suffering from some kind of sleep dysfunction or disorder, and most of those are undiagnosed. Lack of sleep increases irritability (as in, “Who wants to fuck me anyway!”), hormonal problems, apathy, slowed speech and flattened emotional responses. There are health effects, too, which can exacerbate those symptoms. Immune system function goes down: Are you sleep-deprived? Then you really need that condom because you may be more susceptible than ever to catching a disease. Lack of sleep also impacts metabolic function and brain, nervous system, and cardiovascular issues. That doesn’t sound sexy to us. Get some sleep, then get busy. Prioritize sleep and sex!





Stress Bunny, Not Sex Kitten


Stress can come from many directions—work, a partner’s stress, dealing with aging parents, having young kids, having teenagers, money worries, and much more. Any of these can affect your love life and your sleep, which can then further dampen your ardor. And in a truly unfortunate vicious circle, stress and sleep deprivation can be associated with drug and alcohol abuse, weight gain, including dangerous Metabolic Syndrome, hypertension, and emotional problems. Handling stress in your life is crucial beyond being sexual, but we’re sure you really don’t want sexual pleasure to be a victim of stressful life patterns. Don’t wait until you’re in a hospital bed—or beside one—to prioritize health and wellbeing, including sexually. Evaluate your circumstances honestly and change what you can. Do it now to live a longer, healthier life with fewer regrets.

For example, do you fight about money, resent the other person or your boss or the piled-up unpaid bills—then try to just forget about it all and jump in the sack, only to find you can’t enjoy yourself like you used to? Sex should relieve stress, right? Oh, yes—it does if you can let it. Some people can just shut out the world, hold resentment or worry at bay, and have a sexy blast. But other people need a transition between stress and romance, because it doesn’t work when their brain’s in one place and their body’s in another. After commuting for an hour, you might not want to walk in the door and get busy.

Here are some ideas for repairing the damage done by daily stressors. Can you think of others that might be relevant in your own life?



“I have a horrible commute. Then when I walk in the door there’s my family with big smiles, seeming so relaxed. Instead of being grateful to see them, which down deep I am, I feel resentful and irritated. Finally I decided to take a few minutes before I step in the door—I stopped off to read a magazine, listen to a podcast or go for a walk. Even though it makes me even later getting home, taking just ten minutes for myself changes everything about my attitude and blood pressure!”





Maybe you decide to talk about bills in the morning instead of nighttime—or you decide to have sex in the morning. Even a few deep, cleansing breaths can put you in a different mood; and some people add a moment of meditation-like reflection, sometimes involving their partner for a centering check-in. Communicate about what’s really going on. Be self-reflective and thoughtful about your partner’s situation and their own stress as well. Don’t just blame or feel unwanted. Look for the root of the tension and try to separate that from sex if you can. Realistically, what can you do to help yourself or your partner?





Sex and Trauma



You are more powerful than what happened to you.

	–Somatic Healer/Educator Staci Haines





Sexually traumatic experiences in one’s past, such as rape or incest, can make sex seem too far into the “danger” side of the pleasure/danger continuum to risk; many people have found their desire is only freed up after they have undergone therapy or other healing processes to deal with these experiences.

Even if the abuse was not sexual, or long ago—abusive relationships, including emotionally abusive parent/child dynamics, can ensure the trauma stays in your life as an adult—sexuality can be affected; for many people, sexual intimacy involves trust, which is hard to maintain when one’s boundaries, whether physical or emotional, have been consistently violated. Sex and emotions are for most people intertwined, so anyone who has a history of any kind of abuse or trauma can find their sexuality is affected. Problems in a relationship can result in a similar outcome even if the issues do not rise to the level of abuse. Navigating an incident of partner betrayal, for instance, can turn off the trust and the turn-on. And if sexual violence or breach of consent has been part of your experience, flashbacks can intrude on even the most consensual and intimate moments.

If any of this sounds familiar to you, we have one simple but important message: Healing and pleasure are possible. Many other people have undergone a healing journey, and so can you: what’s more, you and your future healthy relationships deserve it. But traumatic experience finds its way into your body even if it was mental or emotional in the first place; you can’t just think your way out of it. Whole-body somatic healing is possible, and some counselors specialize in it. Don’t resist asking for help from trustworthy professionals especially ones trained in mind and body holistic healing.

Staci Haines has written an important book for survivors called Healing Sex: A Mind/Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma. The DVD/streaming version of her work includes helpful advice and sharing from real survivors, addresses people from all walks of life, somatic exercises that can be done again and again, and much more. Her book and DVD has something to help everyone, no matter how big or small the trauma. The Courage to Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass has helped millions of abuse survivors from all walks of life.





Veterans, War, & Other Trauma


Other traumatic experiences can have similar effects. Soldiers often come back from war with erectile dysfunction (ED) or libido issues, and female soldiers may not feel sexual—a man with ED can see the problem and his doctors will understand and be able to diagnose it, while for a woman it may not be as clear to her or her physician. She might not even want to get undressed, or be comfortable enough to approach sex and bodily intimacy at all. This goes double for the vet who is not cisgender. When one or both partners have survived trauma it puts additional stress on marriages and relationships, so if this affects you or a partner, find help.

In some cases, the VA system may have inadequate resources, as in the case of LGBTQQ veterans, and especially soldiers whose abilities to disclose sexual problems have been affected by policies like “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” In a case like this, an organization like Community United Against Violence, a San Francisco LGBTQQ organization, may have resources that veterans’ service organizations do not. Also, some states have problematic VA services for everyone, regardless of their patients’ presenting problems; sexual issues may be considered low priority in some places, so be prepared to advocate for yourself and your healthcare needs.





When Sex Hurts


If sexual contact, particularly insertive sex, like vaginal penetration with a finger, penis or dildo, has become painful or has always had an element of pain associated with it, a person may turn away from sex and intimacy, since any initiation of sexual contact may be associated with pain. Desire can be repressed if this situation isn’t turned around, so anyone experiencing pain with sex may want to seek help for their condition, and ask themselves if they have been painted into a corner by the belief that all sex must include penetration.

Check the sections in this book on chronic disease and disability, arousal, and anal sex to see whether anything included in those discussions rings a bell. Physical conditions that involve sexual pain are grouped under the name dyspareunia, which has recently begun to be called genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. More women than men are troubled by pain with sex, and pain can also, of course, affect people on the trans spectrum. But men are subject to conditions that can cause pain, like Peyronie’s disease.

Some doctors specialize in addressing sexual pain; not all health care providers are knowledgeable about its various causes, and you may need to seek a doctor who does know about its treatment. Medical exams that involve the genitals can be traumatic for all kinds of survivors, including those who have dealt with sexual pain, which affects people’s access to health care. By now you know that we believe you also deserve access to sexual pleasure—and we acknowledge that when sex hurts, it can affect everything from a pelvic exam to your willingness to be in a relationship. We are here to arm you with knowledge so you can get the kind of help you need.

Different kinds of vaginal, vulvar, and pelvic pain cause different sorts of pain: burning upon being entered; pain when a dildo or penis reaches your cervix; and many more. A variety of possibilities exist when you say “pain,” and a good clinician will ask questions to make sure they know what you’re actually experiencing. Before you go to the doctor, think about your experience in detail in order to better help the professionals help you. This can be highly emotional—and that’s understandable. If you start but can’t finish identifying all the details in one sitting, that’s OK. It may help to write things down so that you can return to add new elements when you think of them. Be as specific as you can when describing how long pain with sex has troubled you; whether anything in particular seemed to trigger it; and what you mean by “painful sex”: burning, itching, feeling “stabbed,” pain when the cervix is contacted during intercourse, pain associated with still having a hymen, muscles clenching up, or something else? Try to be as specific as you can.

It’s fairly common for a woman to have pain with penetration because her partner is too large and she is inadequately aroused, or suffering from a vaginal infection, or any of several possible sources of primary pain; and then begin to dread sex. The dread helps ensure you won’t be able to get aroused enough to overcome the discomfort, and sometimes it results in a tensing of the vaginal muscles that gives you a whole secondary source of pain—a response called vaginismus. Thus, a specific problem can become chronic even if it was caused by an infection that has been resolved, or by sexual problems with a partner who is long since out of your life. Once in this cycle, it’s important to explore enough sexually to realize that you can achieve pleasure outside of intercourse, because part of the process of re-learning a pain-free sexuality is being open to other kinds of intimate activities that do bring pleasure. It’s also important to communicate with your partner about this type of pain, for two reasons: if it is a ping-pong infection, in which partners pass a germ back and forth, they will need to be treated too—especially common with male partners, as so many sources of vaginal infection don’t cause noticeable symptoms in guys; and a partner’s understanding can make a real difference in dealing with this, especially so you can prioritize together what kind of sex to engage in.

If sexual trauma or fears around sex are a factor, seeing a therapist with expertise around sexuality might be helpful. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists has a directory; anyone listed in it has undergone an extensive certification process.

Vulvodynia is chronic vulvar pain. This can be generalized across the whole vulva, or can present as burning pain or unpleasant sensitivity specific to the entrance to the vaginal canal. The latter condition is called vulvar vestibulitis, since the scientific name for the vaginal opening is the vestibule. In either case, the pain may be constant, intermittent, or associated with touch or certain sexual activities, such as intercourse. It’s not clear what causes this syndrome, if, indeed, any one thing does. The National Vulvodynia Association website lists some common causes, although some of these can also be associated with other types of sexual pain:

An injury to, or irritation of, the nerves that transmit pain and other sensations from the vulva

An increase in nerve fiber density in the vulvar vestibule

Elevated levels of inflammatory substances in the vulvar tissue

An abnormal response of different types of vulvar cells to environmental factors such as infection or trauma

Altered hormone receptor expression in the vulvar tissue

Genetic susceptibility to chronic vestibular inflammation

Genetic susceptibility to chronic widespread pain

Genetic factors associated with an inability to combat vulvovaginal infection

A localized hypersensitivity to Candida (yeast) or other vulvovaginal organism

Pelvic floor muscle weakness or spasm



Does all that sound like you might need to see a doctor who knows a lot about this condition? Coping with vulvodynia involves identifying any triggering activities or substances; avoiding pressure on the vulva; relieving pain through heat, cool baths or cold packs, relaxation, and medications; and physical therapy to work with pelvic floor muscles or controlling sensation via biofeedback. If vaginal ailments like yeast infections or vaginitis are the cause, treating them is important, but pay attention to any indications that you may be sensitive to the medications used to treat these conditions.

Surgery can be suggested as a treatment for vulvar vestibulitis. However, it’s important to work with a health care provider who knows about the condition and is open-minded about treatments. One women’s care organization, for instance, has seen cases of vulvar vestibulitis in women who are dehydrated; are having intercourse when insufficiently lubricated; have allergies or sensitivities; and are dealing with significant stress. We always favor the least invasive and most holistic ways of dealing with a health issue.

Yeast Infections (Candidiasis): You’ll notice that one of the potential issues with vulvodynia is yeast, and it can cause vaginal pain with intercourse, too. However, unless you have been tested for yeast, it is possible that vaginal symptoms are from another pathogen or other cause. If you haven’t had a doctor do a vaginal culture when you have symptoms, it’s common to be treated for the wrong thing. Planned Parenthood has cited some other possible culprits: bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, allergies and irritants, and lack of the hormone estrogen; and they have noted which sorts of conditions encourage the overgrowth of yeast: taking certain antibiotics or other drugs, such as cortisone; diabetes; a weak immune system; normal changes in your hormone levels; pregnancy; and exposure to someone else’s natural genital yeast or other bacteria that reacts with your body chemistry. It’s possible for an infection to ping-pong back and forth between partners. Oral contraceptives can increase some women’s susceptibility to yeast infections, and so can douching.

Some people believe that Candida (yeast) overgrowth is responsible for various health symptoms and can be treated with diet and supplements. This notion is somewhat controversial and not all doctors are comfortable with it. If you decide to try a low-yeast diet, see an allergist about which symptoms they believe are associated with Candida and keep a diary of them, so you can watch for any patterns that might be relevant and can determine for yourself whether symptoms lessen in conjunction with diet. In this diary it’s also a good idea to note anything else that might be relevant to your vaginal pain with intercourse, including how much time pre-intercourse sex lasts, whether you are having any other health problems, food or medication sensitivities, anything. A diary can be incredibly helpful, and if you can stick to it, the answer to your symptoms might reveal itself based on the notes you keep.

Women with chronic vaginitis and vulvodynia are urged to avoid tight pants, especially made of synthetic materials; wear cotton underwear or none at all; and avoid chemical sources of irritation, like laundry soap, perfumed products, and especially douches.

Vaginismus is vaginal pain, specifically that which occurs from an involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles, often when penetration is attempted. This can range from tightness and burning to total closure of the vagina that makes any penetration impossible. It’s associated with anxiety—understandably!—but it’s not known which causes which. It isn’t psychosomatic: even if it has an emotional cause, in whole or part, it does involve an uncontrollable muscle spasm. But pain or discomfort may cause the spasm; some people with vaginismus have untreated vaginal infections. Kegels and desensitization, support in saying yes and no to penetration, and using graduated-size dildos can help with this condition. And of course it’s important to treat any underlying physical cause and, if a history of abuse is part of the equation, getting help for that can also help.

Vaginismus, vulvodynia and vulvar vestibulitis may appear separately or together, and some clinicians feel they’re fairly commonly associated.

Crotch injuries can occur in people of any gender. Bicycle or motorcycle accidents that result in a person hitting the bike’s central bar are a common cause, but sports injuries, kicks or other impacts can also result in crotch pain and sexual dysfunction. One prominent erotic star of the 1990s was open about having sustained such an injury, which left her unable to orgasm via clitoral stimulation and more interested in vaginal stimulation. Nerve damage can result from this type of accident, and chronic pain is a possibility as well.

Endometriosis is another cause of pelvic pain in which endometrial cells that should be inside the uterus are found outside of it; if pelvic pain is much worse around your period, it’s a hint that this might be the problem. Sometimes pelvic pain of this type is livable—until you try to have intercourse, and find that the movement and thrusting is acutely uncomfortable.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease is pelvic inflammation resulting from infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and other reproductive organs, often by an STI. It can be quite painful, though treating the underlying infection can often help. Untreated infections can cause chronic pelvic pain, though, as well as infertility and the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, which is a very dangerous condition.

Pelvic congestion syndrome is a condition caused by varicose veins—veins whose valves are not closing properly and allow blood to pool in the lower abdomen. We usually think of varicose veins as occurring in the legs, but varicosities can happen in other parts of the body as well—in fact, hemorrhoids are another type. PCS is associated with an aching or throbbing pain in the pelvis which gets worse when sitting, standing, and during and after intercourse, and increases as the day goes on. Pregnancy can worsen it, but its cause is not always clear. Hormonal treatment, surgery to close off the affected vein, and even hysterectomy may be recommended to treat this condition; NSAIDs, warm compresses, and acupuncture can be used to relieve discomfort.

Tipped Uterus: When someone has a tipped or retroverted uterus, it is tilted towards the back, rather than towards the front. It’s fairly common—some sources say that as many as 20-30% of women have one. There are different possible causes, any of which can affect sexual pleasure or cause pain and discomfort. If it’s due to some of the ligaments that hold the uterus being less tight, then odds are that the pain during sex is from impact on the cervix. Of course, that can be painful even for women whose uteri are in the more common position, but it does seem to be more likely when it’s tipped.

Some intercourse positions may simply be uncomfortable. You might find that limiting the depth of penetration helps; rear entry positions generally cause deeper penetration. One option is to keep your knees together. That brings the buttocks closer together and limits how deep thrusting can go; this works better for some people than others.

Another option would be to try different angles. For example, using positioning furniture or pillows so your head is raised above your hips rather than lying in a completely horizontal position might change the angle enough to keep a penis from coming into contact with the cervix. Another rear entry position is to lie flat, not kneeling. If you keep your knees together, with your partner’s knees on the outside of your legs, that can work, too.

A tipped uterus can also be caused by endometriosis or fibroid tumors. Some women have these without experiencing any discomfort, but they can make sex painful. So talk with a doctor to be safe.

Peyronie’s disease: Most men have some curvature to the penis, and in a few it’s very noticeable. Many of their partners like it that way—some curve might make it a bit more likely that the G-spot or prostate is stroked during intercourse. But there’s curved—and then there’s Peyronie’s disease. Peyronie’s involves a curve that’s substantial enough to inhibit intercourse; it can be painful, but is not always. It’s considered a connective tissue disorder and is thought to result from plaque in the body of the penis—if the corpora cavernosa, which are supposed to expand when blood fills them and creates an erection, have non-stretchy scarring in or on them, they won’t fill evenly, but will bend. It’s like sticking a piece of tape on a balloon, then trying to blow it up. A drug to help break up the scarring has been approved by the FDA. The other alternative is surgery; most doctors would rather the patient wait a bit before taking such a measure, because the condition can resolve on its own. In the meantime, don’t handle your penis too roughly (as in trying to forcibly straighten it out) and exacerbate any problem you might have.

Phimosis is a condition that happens when the penile foreskin can’t be retracted and has adhered to the penile head. In fact, a version can also occur clitorally, since the clitoris is also covered by a hood. It isn’t always painful, but it can be. At birth the infant’s foreskin is naturally attached to the head, and it gradually becomes mobile and able to be retracted unless it is removed via circumcision. Phimosis is considered problematic if it happens during or after adolescence, since by this time the foreskin in an uncircumcised person naturally moves back and forth over the head during both intercourse and masturbation. If an inflammation or more serious problem isn’t present, phimosis can often be handled—literally—by gentle stretching and masturbation. Topical steroid creams can help bring down inflammation. Phimosis can be surgically fixed in some cases, and circumcision isn’t always necessary.

Occasionally a circumcision will be done poorly, or may be done on a person who is prone to developing scar tissue, and enough scarring will result to cause penile pain.

Hypospadias is a congenital condition in which the urethral opening is not at the tip of the penis, but on the underside, somewhere along the shaft. It’s often associated with chordee, a downward penile curve (which is different from Peyronie’s, an adult-onset condition). Other anomalies can be associated with it as well. It is sometimes considered indicative of an intersex condition. Generally surgery is performed, usually at an early age, to correct this, and when pain is associated with the condition it can actually be an effect of the genital surgeries, not necessarily of the condition itself.

Prostatitis is an infection or inflammation of the prostate; pain and swelling can result and can affect sexual functioning. Ironically, too little sex—or rather, too-infrequent ejaculation—is considered one possible reason for chronic prostatitis. It can be bacterial or not; when bacteria are present, they are sometimes found to be associated with an STI, but much bacterial prostatitis isn’t sexually transmitted. In addition to prostatic pain, it can also be associated with back and pelvic pain. Prostatitis is not the same as prostate cancer, but it can be disruptive and, because there are several types, must be diagnosed for the correct treatment to be prescribed.





Painful sex can also be associated with:


Menopause: The vaginal walls become thinner and more delicate, inflammation is a possibility, and the vagina itself can become shorter and narrower; muscular response differs—the uterus may not move up and out of the way during intercourse as it did before, making it more likely a penis or toy will contact the cervix and cause pain.

Undiagnosed pain in the abdomen may be assumed to be PID, the results of constipation, or caused by other sources. Consult a doctor. Tumors or abdominal masses can be the cause of unexplained pelvic pain and pain with sex.

A tight, unbroken hymen or an extended perineum over the opening of the vagina.

Cystitis and other bladder issues: UTIs (urinary tract infections) occur in men too, though not as commonly as women suffer from them. In men and trans women they may be associated with prostatitis.

Bowel issues, including constipation.

Pelvic floor myalgia, spasms, or tension: This can be an issue for people of any gender; when the pelvic floor muscles are in spasm it can cause more than vaginismus. This is a musculoskeletal issue, and many doctors aren’t trained to recognize it. Pelvic pain specialists may include physical therapists on staff who can help with trigger point therapies and other treatments.

Infections and skin conditions that make the skin of the genitals sensitive to touch or friction.

Because pelvic pain and pain with sex can be caused by so many different issues, some of them with serious ongoing health implications, it’s always wise to consult a doctor who knows a lot about sexual medicine.





Erectile Issues (Wait, I Can’t Get It Up!)


Erectile dysfunction, or ED, as it has come to be called, is a serious issue for many men. Whether a person isn’t getting hard because his body is no longer able to summon the blood flow or neurological connections that add up to an erection, or is responding to stress or depression with ED, or simply finds his physical response has changed and slowed, leaving him with hard-ons that aren’t very hard and can’t be counted on when he wants to have sex, erectile issues can go right to the heart of some men’s feelings about their masculinity—and maybe their partner’s feelings about that, too. We’ve already talked about the way male sexuality can be so penile-focused that it leads many men to ignore pleasurable possibilities, including sensual and even orgasmic experiences that are possible with a “soft-on.” We’ve told you that some guys strap on a dildo and don’t worry about their erection. But none of this is intended to minimize how it might feel to a person, or a couple, to find that sexual response has changed so activities can’t be enjoyed the way they were in the past.

We like the way our colleague Michael Castleman differentiates between ED, an inability to attain an erection even with direct stimulation, and EDis—erection dissatisfaction. Sometimes this is the result of a real change in the way your body functions, as frequently happens—at least to some extent—over time. Other times it has to do with the expectations we put on our own or a partner’s erectile abilities. In either case, it can cause a lot of stress, which of course makes the issue even more difficult to resolve.

One key to resolving erectile issues is compassion—for ourselves or, if it’s a partner with these issues, for him. Any time our bodies can’t do something they used to do, or something we think they should do, it can be upsetting. From the life-altering—like finding out you are infertile—to daily annoyances like needing to write notes to ourselves to help us remember things, there are moments in life when our bodies don’t respond to “orders,” and this can be humbling. A sexual position that was once a favorite can become vaginally painful for menopausal women or for anyone of any age with a bad hip or back. Looking down and seeing that your penis is not responding the way it once did can be that kind of event. We have information and suggestions for you, but we want to first acknowledge how painful and worrisome this can be.

At the same time, let’s point out that this term erectile dysfunction is a little depressing in and of itself. Many sexologists refuse to use it. They will say “erection issues,” but refrain from adding a layer of distressing “Oh man, I’m broken” language to a situation that is best addressed with compassion and an open mind.

If you do not always get an erection when you want one, or you never do, first see a doctor and get a thorough physical. Many men don’t do this; some feel shyness or shame about speaking to a doctor, while others may not have a current partner so are not motivated to ask whether there’s a medical solution. The most important reason to see your physician is not for a Viagra prescription or some other Rx—it’s to make sure your ED is not the canary in the coal mine of some serious health condition. Remember, some diseases alter sexual functioning, and you must rule these out. The good news—besides the possibility that your penis may thereby save your life—is that treating the underlying disease, if there is one, may help with the ED.





Viagra and You


Viagra and other erection-enhancing medications like Levitra and Cialis, which are longer-lasting, have changed many people’s sex lives, but not everyone should use these drugs. They do not create desire or arousal where it is absent—they only affect whether enough blood can flow into the penis, and stay there, to result in erection. Many users have realized there is far more to good sex than an erect penis, but men with erectile issues may want to see for themselves whether these meds work for them. There are, however, some situations where Viagra is not safe:

	 Don’t take it if using another form of sildenafil, including Revatio

If taking a nitrate medication for chest pain or to control blood pressure

While using poppers

When using another erection-enhancing drug like alprostadil or yohimbine

Grapefruit, including juice, may intensify unwanted side effects, as may excessive alcohol





Get immediate medical attention if you’re taking Viagra and experience:

	 Sudden vision or hearing loss

An erection that lasts longer than four hours

Nausea, dizziness, light-headedness or irregular heartbeat

Pain, numbness, or tingling in chest, neck, arms or jaw

Swelling in hands, ankles or feet





Tell your doctor before being prescribed Viagra about any:

	 Heart problems

Blood cell or bleeding disorders

Blood pressure problems

Liver or kidney disease or stomach ulcer

Retinitis pigmentosa diagnosis

Penile problems such as Peyronie’s condition

Medical recommendations not to have sex





Some people think of Viagra as a recreational drug—you take it and have sex! Sounds like that could be fun and recreational, sure, but all the PDE5 inhibitor medications (the category that supports blood flow to create penile erections) are serious business and must be taken, or not, with your overall health in mind.





When seeing a doctor, if your sexual issues are not taken seriously, find a different doctor if at all possible. An MD should never just hand over a prescription for Viagra without fully examining you, doing a full intake of all medications and a patient history that includes lifestyle questions. The doctor will try to pinpoint a reason for your issues, which might involve medical testing. You might say, “Well, I don’t want to go through all that trouble,” or “I don’t have time,” or “It’s not important to me”—but we are guessing you are very important to somebody, so be frank with your doctor, whether to simply relieve your worry or whether taking action actually saves your life.

The doctor may also find that erectile problems are due to medications you are already taking for some other condition. Don’t just stop taking a medication you need, but do talk to your doctor to see if there is a way to work around it.

No drug company will make a lot of money on these “lifestyle” issues, but doctors agree that they would prescribe way fewer blue pills if more men:

	 quit smoking

ate a healthier, lower-fat diet

drank alcohol in moderation, if they do drink

exercised regularly—follow the recommendations for heart health



So the very first thing you can do if you find you have erection issues, right after you make an appointment with your doctor, is to tackle these lifestyle changes. You and your penis will be healthier for it. Everyone’s health and sexuality, in fact, regardless of gender, will be supported by these changes.

Next, honestly ask yourself whether there is stress in your life or relationship that might affect your feelings of safety, trust, and desire. Some men think that if they’re “real men” they should be able to power through any emotional challenges and “perform”—and may find that their penis disagrees with this idea of what a “real man” is. The good news is, once a person confronts the more complicated realities of sex, a far more enjoyable sex life often ensues.

Another part of erection and “performance” is the idea that it’s normal for a man to get a hard-on merely by seeing the person he desires; in fact, this is not the case for all, and it’s particularly normal to find that physical touching and stroking a penis is required especially as men age. Enjoy it! It’s beyond us why having one’s penis consensually stroked could be considered anything but lovely. Hint: Stroking down the length of the penis toward the tip, not up toward the abdomen, brings more blood into the erection.

Sometimes an erection can be lost because of a distraction, so try to allow for a pleasant and diversion-free space for your erotic adventures; definitely turn the cell phone off or leave it outside the bedroom!

Some men find it difficult to retain a firm enough erection for insertion and intercourse. We’ve already discussed toys that might affect your intercourse experience, like wearable sleeves. Think about the hydraulics of it, too. Let gravity assist blood flow to the penis; partner-on-top might be less successful than missionary position. Some women can literally stuff a partially soft penis inside the vagina and use the PC muscles to create sensations enjoyable for both partners. Explore whether, during missionary position, your partner can try changing position with pillows under the hips to help accommodate a partially erect penis; this way, instead of sliding in, the penis slides down.

And it may be that your erection issues are due to “pelvic steal syndrome”—this happens when pelvic and surrounding muscles are so tight that they “steal” blood flow that would otherwise reach the penis and create a firm erection. This can also be associated with a partially blocked iliac artery, another good reason to see a physician about ED symptoms. In this case, erection is lost when thrusting. Solution—besides a trip to the doc—can involve lying on your back or side, or having your partner do the thrusting instead.

Besides Viagra and comparable medications, there are a couple of medical strategies to handle ED that require a visit to the physician. One is noninvasive; it’s called an “external vacuum device,” that resembles a penis pump. We do not recommend penis pumps for erectile issues—but your doctor might; openly discuss this option and find out whether your insurance will cover it. This item requires a prescription, which you can only get with a work-up that ensures it is safe for you. It is not safe for people with certain medical problems. After pumping, you put an elastic band—we’d call it a cock ring—on the penis to retain the blood in the erection before taking the device off. Reports vary regarding how well this works—from 30-80%, which is a wide variance—but because it’s non-invasive, it might be worth a try before turning to other methods.

Some men use alprostadil or other erection medications that are injected into the penis with a fine-tipped, short needle. Some people hate needles, of course, and might never elect to try this method; others use it regularly and find it works well for them. Because it’s a local injection rather than an oral medication, side effects will often be less full-body, and unless a person is allergic to the medications themselves, this is a strategy that might be worth considering.

We also want to repeat our message that’s included throughout this book: A healthy whole you is a healthy sexual you. By loving yourself, accepting yourself where you are right now, developing healthy habits, and making a commitment to move forward positively, you are avoiding a road of shame, dead ends and hopelessness. Erectile issues are most certainly not all in the head, at least not always, but any physical manifestation of this type of problem can be made worse by performance anxiety, so keep an open mind about what pleasure and sex are!





I’m Not My Old Horny Self: Loss of Sexual Interest


If you used to feel intensely connected to your sexual feelings but now you’re not, it’s time to ask yourself some serious questions, then subsequently take your concerns to the appropriate doctor. Loss of sexual interest and feeling is often the “canary in the coal mine” warning you that something about your health and well-being has changed.

Look at these depression symptoms and see if they resonate with you: change in sleep, either sleeping all day or insomnia; appetite changes, either overeating or lack of appetite; thoughts of apathy or suicide: These are just a few of the more common symptoms. Loss of libido is, too. We have more about depression below.

Are you, or have you been in the past, in a partnership where you feel coerced into sex, or abused or controlled by a partner in other ways? Does the sentence “I don’t have control over my choices today” feel true for you? While this situation could be linked to depression, it can also exist without that factor. Unhealthy partner dynamics can happen to anyone.

Have you had any significant physical changes that worry you or make you uncomfortable?

How active are you? Sitting around watching TV or online chatting is not the way to keep your body and mind ready and willing for sex. Sedentary living affects blood flow, and may also be associated with other problems like depression. Some people get their sex drive and ability to feel pleasure back simply by exercising, especially engaging in core workouts or anything else that involves the pelvis. That’s right—we’re not only giving you permission to go dancing; we’re practically prescribing it. Though see a doctor about heart health before adding strenuous exercise to your repertoire.

Many medications affect libido. Probably most notorious are the SSRIs, used to treat depression. We know, it is totally not fair that depression hurts libido and depression meds can, too. Also associated with decreased desire are blood pressure meds; drugs that treat diabetes; some hormonal treatments, including birth control pills; ulcer meds; and medications that treat male pattern baldness, acne, chronic pain, and high cholesterol.

If you have the genetics that predispose you to high blood pressure or the potential for other serious ailments, then please save your own life and take your medication. But remember, to maintain sexual health is to maintain overall health. Your blood pumping healthily through your veins makes for better sex.

When you are prescribed medications, ask everyone you can how they might affect your sex life. There is no reason to be embarrassed by that question. Start with the prescribing doctor, ask the pharmacist, and try one of the better medical websites to be certain that everyone provides similar information. If their responses vary, then you are going to have to buckle down and get the real story from another doctor or specialist. Just as you want to know if you have to take medication with food, if it’s unsafe to drive, if it will cause your skin to sunburn or develop a rash, your doctor and pharmacist need to warn you of possible sexual side effects, and please note: you need to ask about side effects because sometimes that warning won’t be delivered. Your sexuality is just as important as your stomach, and if you’re taking a medication that will make you nauseous or give you ulcers, generally that’s said right up front! We’re not counseling you to avoid a life-saving medication, but to get all the side effects info in order to do something to counter those effects. If your medication is for a less dire or life-threatening condition, or of a type where you have more choices, then you will want to know that too, so you can investigate any alternatives.





Depression


With regard to sexuality, depression can cause a confusing cycle of “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” Let us validate your experience—this is hard to figure out, and nothing is “just your imagination.” Many times people who are depressed do not feel sexual. Then they might take medicine for depression and start to feel better in many aspects of their lives, but the medications themselves often have an anti-sexual effect. Let’s look at each step in this cycle:

Take medicine

Feel more outgoing, friendly, or content, or stable, or functional, or what-have-you on a daily basis

As someone more engaged (or less anxious or depressed), feel more connected to others, interested in partners, or notice potential love/sex interests

Still don’t feel sexual and/or try to have sex but it doesn’t go as planned—either erectile issues or lack of ability to orgasm or “what I used to like just doesn’t do it for me anymore.”



Different people respond differently to SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, the category of medication into which most currently-prescribed antidepressants fall). It may be worth switching meds to see whether Wellbutrin, for instance, which is not an SSRI, works better in terms of sexual side effects than Prozac or Paxil.





Hormonal Changes and Problems


From an endocrinological perspective —that’s the study of hormonal body chemistry—we might say that our entire life path, sexually speaking, is dictated by the actions of our hormones, and even the most well-trodden pathway has at least a couple of roller-coaster hills and valleys. Hormonal changes tend to affect our sexual feelings and our bodies, sometimes profoundly.

The body changes radically, sex-wise, during puberty; sexual desire tends to increase as hormonal upsurges prepare the young individual for an eventual adult sex life. Into adulthood, libido can ride a monthly wave that follows the menstrual cycle, and many women also have PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) in varying levels of severity. It’s not uncommon for PMS and its manifestations to quash the sex drive, though sometimes it can have the opposite effect. Low libido can be a side effect of hormonal birth control, too. For some, pregnancy is in the cards, and pre- and postnatal hormonal changes can affect sex and libido then as well.

It’s well-understood that menopausal changes can affect sexual feelings quite a lot, but you don’t have to be fifty-five and menopausal to have depleting sex hormones. As a matter of fact, you don’t even have to be a woman to experience this kind of mid-life libido change! Scientists do not completely have a handle on “man-o-pause,” sometimes termed “andropause,” but it happens, and recent research suggests it has to do not only with a drop in testosterone levels, but with a dip in estrogen levels too, just as in menopause. Much is still to be learned about this time of life, especially as far as sex is concerned, but any mid-life or older person can counter sexual changes with an active lifestyle—exercise keeps the hormones flowing at higher levels—and by keeping an open mind about pleasure. How you had sex at twenty-one, if you did, is not the ruler to measure yourself against. Do what feels good right now. Enjoy it without judgment.

Most people experience hormonal changes that are well within the range of “normal” for their gender and age. The hormonal dip at menopause may exacerbate, but not necessarily cause, any lowered libido that might trouble a mid-life woman; some adolescents will be slower to develop sexually than others, which may have to do with social factors as well as body chemistry; and pregnancy sometimes jacks up desire rather than lowers it, while sleep deprivation and stress, not to mention the body changes that pregnancy caused, may have a role to play when young mothers take a while to get back in the saddle again. But in some cases, individuals’ hormonal changes can be evaluated medically and supplemented with hormone replacement therapy, or are in fact caused by medical interventions like hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and sometimes the ovaries) or certain kinds of cancer treatments. In any event, sexual changes associated with hormonal fluctuations are often gradual, and physical illnesses (including depression) may present with decreased sexual desire, too, so visiting a physician is often the right course of action if you notice a loss of libido that you can’t tie to any other cause.

The so-called “sex hormones” are not the only relevant part of the endocrine system. Diabetes is an endocrine disorder and, as we’ve seen, can affect sexual functioning in many ways. Hypothyroid conditions, in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough of its metabolism-regulating hormones, are linked with low energy and other issues, but also with lowered sex drive. A revved-up thyroid might cause problems as well. Adrenal and pituitary problems, such as tumors, may also result in libido loss, even further reminders that our erotic lives are not at all separable from our overall well-being. See a doctor to help explain if your sex drive goes downhill!





Changing Body


People who have had major surgery or have a “new” body for some reason—from pregnancy to the changes that come with age, hysterectomy or mastectomy, weight gain or loss, diabetic or other health issues, gender realignment hormones and surgery—can find these changes cause stress and libido issues even if they’re associated with a good outcome, like handling a threatening illness or becoming more fit. The entire gamut of body changes can cause vulnerability, from not knowing how your changed body will respond, or getting used to changes in response, or worries about what you look like, or that your partner wants you as you were and will not love or desire you as you are.





Partner Issues with Lack of Desire


What if it’s not you, but your sweetheart, who doesn’t feel sexual anymore, while you continue to desire an unresponsive partner? This can be a heartbreaking situation for both people.

Sometimes we’ll greet a customer in the store who wants to get a toy for their partner; in helping them choose something, it will emerge that either they are a low-libido person who wants to make sure their partner has a compensatory plaything, or that they hope a toy will wake up their lover’s sex drive. They’ve just given us a glimpse into the frustration and lack of communication generated by this kind of tale of mismatched libidos and, often, mistaken assumptions. While sex toys have a place in many kinds of bedrooms, and in either of these cases a toy might be a good idea, let us be the first to tell you that getting a sex toy for a partner who’s not interested in sex is hardly a guaranteed fix, and it might even start a fight. We like to sell toys to people who will use and appreciate them.

We’ve explored many sources of low libido: Did any of them ring a bell or arouse suspicion that your partner may be struggling with the issues mentioned? It’s important to be able to talk about this, but sometimes the low-desire partner will simply not know what’s wrong. Also they might have a difficult time discussing it if the topic saddens them, scares them or makes them feel inadequate as a partner, and if they have a history of shame or trauma around sex it can make it even harder for them to open up. Nevertheless, a heart-to-heart between partners, even if tears are included, may reveal details that could help. Was there a time you can pinpoint when your sexual relationship changed? What was going on at that time? Also explore sources of unacknowledged stress and go over health and other life events together for clues. Sometimes gaining a better understanding of common sources of libido loss will help: We have heard many new parents, for instance, decry the way their sexual relationship has suffered with a new baby in the house, and although this is an extremely common situation, it might not have been on their radar.

Usually there is some sort of explanation for a substantial change, and often it has to do with either relationship dynamics or the body. One response of a supportive partner can be to urge their partner to see a physician to tell the doc there’s been a significant change in their level of desire; doctors are not mind-readers. As mentioned above, sometimes this is one of the first signs of an emerging physical ailment, from depression to cancer. It is not simply a mental thing—it is often physical, and ought to be evaluated as such.

When it’s emotional, it may have to do with relationship problems or issues, including mismatched expectations and difficulties with communication. Many couples have had to learn new patterns of communication to deal with relationship challenges. Common sources of relationship distress that can lead to sexual problems like lack of desire include:

One or the other partner feeling judged, taken for granted, or not listened to by the other.

A breach of trust, as in an affair.

The low-desire partner has felt that their sexual needs have gone unrecognized or unmet, and gradually turns off.

Needs for support in a stressful situation, including post-baby, have not been met.

Other kinds of stress or grief: a death in the family, an ailing parent; a child’s illness or disability.

Not feeling “safe.”

A history of sexual or emotional abuse.

Emerging sexual orientation or gender identity issues.



It can be challenging for the partner of a low-desire person to drop any defensiveness and assess whether these kinds of issues may be affecting their relationship, but it’s important to do so. When members of a couple have begun to take each other for granted, they’re on a slippery slope unless they can revive the ability to listen to each other and take each others’ feelings seriously.

If you feel upset, or that your lack of sexually positive experiences is a problem for you or your partner, then let’s explore further options beyond doctor’s and couple’s therapist’s offices.

Some couples find success in scheduling intimate, no-expectation dates, where the only rule is to treat each other with love and respect and to work toward comfort with sensual touch and connection. The theory goes that intimacy taken out of a “desire-must-lead-to-intercourse” setting can alleviate the stress or reluctance to let down one’s guard and connect. Related to this is the idea that being willing to have sex, rather than waiting for active desire or drive, is enough to get many people into a sexually active state, and pleasure can follow. This is especially useful if the main problem is initiative and libido, but not so good if turn-off follows the entire sexual experience or sexual pain is involved. It also often matters that the partner is comfortable initiating; if one person is willing but not assertive while the other is desirous but uncomfortable making the first move, a stalemate can result.





Have It Your Way and My Way


Some couples respect each other’s differing desires and incorporate masturbation as an important part of each partner’s, or at least the most desirous partner’s, sex life, sometimes adding mutual masturbation or masturbating together to their repertoire. This togetherness maintains intimacy and connection but doesn’t result in pressure to respond.

Some couples open their relationship because they have differing desires. This can take a lot of work to do well, but there is a growing literature on polyamory to help those who’d like to try this option.





STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection) Facts


Sex can be so fabulous that sometimes members of the microscopic kingdoms—like bacteria and viruses—come along for the ride. As we’ve pointed out elsewhere, this makes them just like other diseases that pass from human to human, though when you get the flu from your lover you don’t usually call it a “sexually transmitted infection.” Many people are especially upset about STIs, but this may be associated with a long-standing social shame about them; most people learn this reaction with all the other attitudes about sex that they absorb well before adulthood.

Another issue is that to talk to people about STIs, you have to talk about sex, and the whole discussion can become politicized or fraught. It doesn’t have to be this way, and we’d just like to remind you that we would have way fewer STIs if we were able, in our families, sex education classes, relationships, and media, to discuss these conditions and their prevention in a calm and matter-of-fact way. We don’t say this to minimize STIs—it’s way better not to get any. Some of them can have serious and even life-threatening consequences. In our pregnancy chapter, we remind you how dangerous some of these conditions can be for those who are pregnant. But prevention and timely treatment are both supported by awareness. If you think you have an STI, don’t panic—go to the doctor. And tell any sexual partners so that they can do the same. It is quite common for partners to have an infection too, with no symptoms, and if they’re not tested or treated, they can give the infection right back to you even if you get treatment right away.

People of any sexual orientation can catch STIs, though penis-vagina and penis-anus intercourse may be the most risky activities for transmission of most of these bugs. In the detailed information below, when we say “genital contact,” we also mean penis/anus sex, because virtually all STIs that can be passed during vaginal intercourse are transmissible through anal intercourse as well. In some cases, the mechanics of transmission mean it’s more likely for one gender or the other to get a particular infection, but no sexually active person should be assumed to be immune. And in case you were waiting for scary symptoms to show up before your doctor visit, the most common symptom of an STI is no symptoms at all. So if you’re sexually active, inform your doc so you can get the kind of tests and advice you need. Complete your course of antibiotics or other treatment even if you begin to feel better and your symptoms go away. Some people are quite susceptible to yeast infections when they take antibiotics, and many choose to eat live-culture yogurt or other probiotics to support the “good” bacteria that help keep Candidiasis (yeast) in check.

Here is some basic information about many STIs and conditions—some common, others fairly rare, and a few quite serious. Scientific and medical information is always subject to new insight, so make this the start, and not the end point, of your awareness of STIs.





Bacterial Vaginosis


What is it? While bacterial vaginosis (BV) is not a sexually transmitted infection per se, it is likely that it can be sexually transmitted, and it increases the risk of contracting another STI. That’s why we include it here. BV is caused by an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that upset the vaginal flora—the natural balance of microorganisms that live in the healthy vagina. It’s an extremely common vaginal infection.

How does one contract it? It’s not always clear how you get BV. It may be more likely if you have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners, which implicates coming into contact with new bacteria and changing the balance in the vagina. Women may be able to pass BV to other women. Douching is also thought to be a risk factor.

What does it do? It increases your likelihood of getting other STIs, including HIV and other infections that may increase the risk of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease).

What are some of its symptoms? You may have no symptoms, or vaginal itching, greyish-white or yellow discharge, and an “off” or fishy smell.

How do you protect from it? Condom use may help.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics, in some cases given in pill form, and in other cases as a vaginal cream.





Chancroid


What is it? A bacterial infection. It is less common in the US and Canada than in other parts of the world; some consider it a “tropical” STI.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? It causes genital ulcerations and sores that may be quite painful.

What are some of its symptoms? The sore/s are preceded by a tender raised bump on the external body, or inside the vagina or rectum; painful sex and urination in women; infection can spread to other parts of the body through breaks in the skin; more commonly seen in men; more outbreaks in those who have another STI, and in drug users; and it can affect the lymph glands in the groin and cause them to become swollen and painful.

How do you protect from it? Condoms can help reduce risk.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics.





Chlamydia


What is it? Most commonly-reported bacterial STI in the US. One can be re-infected after being cured of a previous case.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? It can cause irreversible damage in women, including infertility. It can cause PID; increases chances of transmitting HIV.

What are some of its symptoms? It can cause vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, penile discharge and/or swollen or painful testicles, pain with urination, lower abdominal pain, fever, and—if exposed through anal sex—rectal pain or discharge.

How do you protect from it? Condom use. It can be passed whether or not partner ejaculates. Abstain from unprotected sex until antibiotics have all been taken; any sexually active woman who has multiple partners, a new partner, doesn’t use barriers, or who hasn’t been checked for it recently ought to be tested annually.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics.





Gonorrhea


What is it? A curable bacterial disease; one can be re-infected.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? It can cause heart problems, blindness and arthritis. Can cause PID and other damage to reproductive organs, possible infertility; increases chances of transmitting HIV.

What are some of its symptoms? It can cause thick yellow or grey vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, penile discharge and/or swollen or painful testicles, pain with urination and greater urinary frequency, lower abdominal pain, fever, and—if exposed through anal sex—rectal pain or discharge.

How do you protect from it? Condom use. Can be passed whether or not partner ejaculates.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics. Resistant strains are developing, so following doctor’s instructions is very important.





Granuloma Inguinale


What is it? A bacterial infection. It is rare in the US and Canada; some consider it a “tropical” STI. It is sometimes also called Donovanosis.

How does one contract it? By genital/anal or (much more rarely) oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? It will continue to spread and affect healthy tissues, leaving lesions called granulomas. It makes other kinds of infections, including STIs, more likely on the affected tissue.

What are some of its symptoms? A painless, beefy-red genital ulcer may lead to more severe lesions; the bacterium, if untreated, will continue to eat away at the tissues.

How do you protect from it? Condom use will help if the infection is on areas of the genitals that the condom protects.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics.





Hepatitis B


What is it? A viral liver disease.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person. Also spread via infected blood from needles or other sources of exposure.

What does it do? It may lead to an increased chance of liver disease or cancer.

What are some of its symptoms? Fever, fatigue, loss of appetite; body itching; yellowed eyes and/or skin; dark urine, light-colored stool.

How do you protect from it? The Centers for Disease control suggest that everyone being evaluated/treated for an STI should receive a Hepatitis B vaccine, and men who have sex with men and intravenous drug users should get a Hepatitis A vaccination as well; incubation period is six weeks to six months; all sex partners, injection drug partners, and household members of infected persons should be vaccinated; HIV infection can impair the response to vaccination; because of Hepatitis B’s effect on the liver, alcohol should be avoided in Hep B-positive persons and a doctor should be consulted before taking any new medications, including over-the-counter and herbal remedies. Hepatitis A and C are also considered sexually transmissible in some cases (Hepatitis A especially via rimming and Hepatitis C especially in HIV-positive persons).

What are the treatments? Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and longer-term antiviral therapy are possible treatments. Later-stage hepatitis B can involve, in an extreme case, a liver transplant. There is a vaccine for hepatitis B; at-risk individuals should ask about it.





Herpes


What is it? Viral disease with no cure that may cause no symptoms or be symptomatic. Most people who have herpes virus likely do not know they are infected; virus can be transmitted from skin that looks normal, not exclusively when lesions/rash are present; some people have “prodromal” symptoms before outbreaks recur.

How does one contract it? By genital or other physical, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, including oral sex.

What does it do? Systemically affects the body and may be asymptomatic or result in regular or occasional outbreaks.

What are some of its symptom? Blisters or sores at the site of infection are the most noticeable symptom; they may be painful, itchy, and include tingling or shooting pains; can increase the risk of HIV transmission and contracting HIV—it’s being studied whether treating the herpes will have an effect on this transmissibility. Flu-like symptoms can be associated with it, and illness or stress appears to make outbreaks more likely.

How do you protect from it? Depending on the location of the herpes outbreaks, condoms may not protect against transmission if lesions are in a place not covered by the condom. People with recurrent outbreaks may be able to pass the virus at any time if they are not taking suppressive medication, but they must definitely become aware of the “prodrome” stage, before the outbreak is visible but when the lesion site has begun to feel more sensitive, itchy, and tingly—they are shedding virus and contagious at this time.

What are the treatments? Suppressive antiviral medication can be taken daily or at the first sign of a recurring outbreak’s prodrome stage.





HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)


What is it? An incurable viral disease that attacks immune system cells, which may give rise to a range of diseases.

How does one contract it? By genital contact with an infected person or via contact with infected blood. Having other STIs increase chances of transmitting and getting HIV, and treating STIs will have some protective effect on this, lessening the risk somewhat.

What does it do? HIV affects CD4 cells (or T-cells) in the immune system, making an infected person unable to fight off disease; AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is diagnosed when various opportunistic infections are present (or when T-cell count falls under two hundred).

What are some of its symptoms? When one contracts HIV they may become ill with flu-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and/or swollen lymph glands. Symptoms of HIV’s opportunistic infections include persistent cough, certain body rashes, white spots in the mouth, a yeast infection that won’t go away, and unexplained weight loss and fatigue.

How do you protect from it? Condom use and refraining from coming in contact with inflected blood. PreP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a medication that is used to prevent getting HIV; discuss this with your doctor.

What are the treatments? In many cases it can be controlled by antiretroviral medications. Anti-retroviral drug therapy can also lower, though not eliminate, the risk of transmitting HIV during the period of clinical latency, the asymptomatic period before any opportunistic infection manifests.





HPV (Human Papillomavirus)


What is it? A viral disease. It is the most common STI, with around one hundred strains known. It is sometimes called genital (or anal) warts, but many strains of HPV do not result in warts at all.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? Some HPV strains cause cancer in some people; warts and cancer both result from changes that the virus has caused in cells—normal cells become abnormal in one way or another; it’s possible to have more than one strain at the same time; most people infected don’t know they have it; it can persist in the body, though some people seem to get over it; those with weak immune systems, including HIV, are probably more likely to have persistent or symptomatic HPV.

What are some of its symptoms? Some strains cause warts: painless growths on or in the anal/genital regions.

How do you protect from it? Condom use.

What are the treatments? The virus can’t be treated, but the problems it causes—from warts to cancer—can be treated appropriately. A vaccine now exists that can prevent the most problematic strains, and young people ages eleven and older are encouraged to be vaccinated. Should susceptible adults be vaccinated? Some docs think it couldn’t hurt.





Pubic Lice


What is it? These are very small parasites, not microbes. They are sometimes known as “crabs.”

How does one contract it? By genital contact with an infected person; more rarely, from infested linens or clothes. Lice is not just an STI; kids can get lice from each other at school.

What does it do? They live attached to human pubic hairs and feed on blood. They can attach to other hair as well, though when they do they aren’t considered an STI.

What are some of its symptoms? Itching and rash. Can infect other areas with hair, not just the pubic area, including eyelashes and brows; feeling run down or mildly feverish; inflamed skin can occur; the bugs can be seen through a magnifying glass.

How do you protect from it? Avoid sex with a person with lice and contacting infested clothing. Decontaminate bedding, vacuum upholstery.

What are the treatments? Over-the counter or prescription medications can kill the lice and their eggs. Follow instructions carefully.





Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV)


What is it? A bacterial infection caused by a strain of the Chlamydia bacterium—not the same one that causes the more common Chlamydia infections discussed above. It is less common in the US and Canada than in other parts of the world; some consider it a “tropical” STI. It primarily affects the lymph nodes. More HIV-positive people get it than those without HIV.

How does one contract it? By genital/anal or (more rarely) oral/genital contact with an infected person. It enters through breaks in the skin or via the mucosa.

What does it do? LGV can become a chronic infection of the lymphatic system and cause significant physical changes including swelling and inflammation, rectal scarring, and systemic infection.

What are some of its symptoms? It begins with a painless genital ulcer and progresses to swollen and painful lymph nodes in the groin or, if contracted anally, to rectal symptoms including inflammation, pain, and discharge. Fever and malaise will accompany these symptoms.

How do you protect from it? Condom use.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics; the lymph nodes may need to be drained if abscesses have formed. Partners should be treated too.





Molluscum


What is it? A viral infection. It is less common in the US and Canada than in other parts of the world; some consider it a “tropical” infection. It is often, but not always, sexually transmitted; kids actually are most susceptible, especially in daycare and other group situations.

How does one contract it? By skin, genital, or anal contact with an infected person; by contact with an item that carries the virus, such as a towel or clothing.

What does it do? It results in an outbreak of dome-shaped skin lesions. These may go away on their own, but often it takes a long time. The infection is contagious as long as the lesions are present; once they’re gone, the virus is gone too, and does not go dormant as herpes does.

What are some of its symptoms? The skin lesions are molluscum’s primary symptom. These may itch or become infected and may spread.

How do you protect from it? Condom use, if the lesions are on the penis or an area of the genitals that may contact a penis; handwashing; avoiding infected items and surfaces.

What are the treatments? Molluscum lesions are treated much like warts and may be burned off chemically or via laser or cryotherapy, or scraped off in a process called curettage.





PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)


What is it? This is not an STI per se, but rather the outcome of untreated STIs. Progressive infection is most often caused by the gonorrhea and/or chlamydia organisms, but 20% of cases have no certain or identifiable cause.

How does one contract it? It results from untreated or inadequately-treated STIs like gonorrhea, chlamydia, and bacterial vaginosis, which may or may not be sexually transmitted.

What does it do? It infects the uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes, causing scarring, chronic pain, and sometimes infertility. It is a significant cause of ectopic pregnancy, in which the fetus begins to grow outside the uterus.

What are some of its symptom? Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, pain during intercourse and/or urination, abnormal periods (irregular, longer or more painful than usual, constant spotting), fever/chills/nausea/vomiting in serious cases; symptoms can be confused with other, even more serious infections.

How do you protect from it? Avoid bacterial vaginal infections that may lead to it. It’s very important to get treated/checked right away when symptoms begin; women who douche may be at higher risk; male sex partners should be checked for bacterial STIs.

What are the treatments? The underlying pathogen is treated with antibacterial medications and, if pelvic abscesses have formed, with surgery.





Scabies


What is it? These are very small mites, not microbes.

How does one contract it? By genital or other physical, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. Like lice, these can be transmitted in other than sexual ways. Very contagious, even through holding hands. Also from infested linens or clothes.

What does it do? Scabies burrow under the skin.

What are some of its symptoms? Intense itching, often worse at night. Red rash, scaly or crusty skin can accompany; a hard-to-see zigzag blister or lesion may be the first thing to appear; usually begins in the body’s folds and crevices.

How do you protect from it? Avoid sex with a person with scabies and contacting infested clothing. Decontaminate bedding, vacuum upholstery; follow treatment instructions carefully.

What are the treatments? Prescription medicines called scabicides will kill the mites.





Syphilis


What is it? A bacterial infection that can damage the body in three distinct stages. Easy to cure in early stages; many US cases are now men who have sex with men, and it disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic communities; puts one at higher risk of contracting HIV; second stage can also include mucous membrane sores; HIV-positive people can get a range of different effects; pregnant women should be tested, and those at risk for, or in high-syphilis areas, should be tested more than once during pregnancy and if positive, treated with penicillin; re-infection can occur.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? The infection moves from its point of entry on the body, where it will be marked by a distinctive sore called a chancre, and becomes a systemic disease which can cause severe health problems years later.

What are some of its symptoms? Early-stage symptoms are the chancre, a raised, painless sore/s that will go away on its own, followed by a stage that is marked by a rash and/or mucous membrane sores plus flu-like symptoms; can pass from a pregnant woman to her baby; late-stage syphilis can appear many years later and include organ damage, paralysis, blindness, and dementia.

How do you protect from it? Condom use.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics.





Trichomoniasis


What is it? A genital-tract infection caused by a protozoan. It’s the most common curable STI.

How does one contract it? By genital or oral/genital contact with an infected person.

What does it do? Can cause prostate infection; can increase chances of getting HIV; more common in women, older women more likely to have been infected; having it can make vaginal sex feel unpleasant; can be re-infected, so all sex partners should be treated.

What are some of its symptoms? Vaginal or penile discharge, itching, burning or pain with urination. Often no symptoms: 70% of those infected have no symptoms, and symptom-free people can still pass it to others.

How do you protect from it? Condom use.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics.





Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)


What is it? This is not an STI per se, but rather, like PID, may be (but is not always) the outcome of other untreated STIs. It is a bacterial infection that occurs when bacteria invade the urinary tract: the urethra, bladder, kidneys and/or ureters. Women are especially likely to contract a UTI because their urethras are shorter; the bacteria don’t have as far to go to cause trouble. Also known as cystitis or bladder infection.

How does one contract it? In various ways, including via intercourse, which allows bacteria to be pushed into the urethra. These may be the natural bacteria from the anal tract, STI bacteria, or other microorganisms that shouldn’t be in the urinary tract. Holding off on urination is also a risk factor. It may be more common when women are pregnant or in menopause.

What does it do? A UTI results in painful urination and possible kidney infection. The latter is a serious condition.

What are some of its symptoms? A UTI can cause pain or burning with urination and causes urinary urgency—a feeling that you need to urinate right away and can’t hold it—and frequent urination, though you may produce little urine each time. Back pain, chills, nausea, and vomiting may occur if the bacteria reaches the kidneys.

How do you protect from it? Maintain good personal hygiene and wipe from front to back when you use the toilet; at least some UTI doctors say that it’s caused by bacteria in fecal matter 90% of the time and recommend using antiseptic wipes on the vulva after bowel movements. Urinate after intercourse or other insertive sex. Drink lots of water. Using a diaphragm for contraception might increase risk, since this puts extra pressure on the urethra.

What are the treatments? Antibiotics. Some find that acidifying the urine will help—cranberry juice might do the trick, or Vitamin C; it’s also important to drink lots of water to help flush out the bacteria.





Vaginitis


What is it? Vaginal inflammation or infection. This is not an STI per se, but rather it may be—but is not always—the outcome of other untreated STIs, including chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and gonorrhea, or can develop from yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. You can have more than one of these at a time, which may complicate diagnosis and treatment.

How does one contract it? By genital contact with an infected person; other methods depend on which pathogen causes it.

What does it do? Can cause unpleasant vaginal sensations and may be linked to PID and an increased chance of getting other STIs.

What are some of its symptoms? Vaginal discharge, itching, burning with urination, pain or discomfort during sex, especially insertive sex.

How do you protect from it? Condom use will help if a sex partner has an STI, but some vaginitis is not a result of sexual activity or STI infection.

What are the treatments? It depends on the pathogen that has caused the infection. Often, the treatment will involve a course of antibiotics orally or via a vaginal cream.





Disability & Sex


We’re not all the same; we’ve just filled many pages counting the ways that each of us is unique. But there’s another area of diversity to address when we discuss sex, associated with the ways, and limitations to the ways, our bodies function. We’re talking about disability and differing kinds and levels of ability. Many people think these are synonymous; although they can be, some disability community members and advocates differentiate them: Disability refers to an acquired change in function from an accident, an illness, or other life- and ability-altering experience, while the phrase “differently abled” may be used for someone who has had different bodily configurations or abilities from birth, and who has grown up with them. In the first case, a person must learn their body and its abilities and responses anew. In the second, a person will have had no experience in a body other than the one they’ve always had—it’s simply the way they are.

Over time we will almost all undergo changes that cause our bodies to lose certain abilities or behave differently. So even if you consider yourself perfectly healthy, be aware that someday it’s as likely as not that you, too, will be disabled; even if it’s just for a short period, it will change your world, and it may very well lead you to see your sexuality, and many other things as well, through new eyes.

“It took seven years of working with my partners to rearrange my sexuality into a functioning structure,” said one man who was disabled by chronic pain. “But I constantly miss my old preferences. I do have an acknowledged disability, called ‘loss of ability to engage in sexual congress.’ But that doesn’t acknowledge at all many of the sexual things I can’t do any more—it only refers to intercourse.”

In either case, acquired or inborn, if you are a person with a disability or differently abled, you may have noticed that other people are to varying degrees supportive or else have difficulty dealing with your difference from the “norm”—hence the limited “sexual congress” definition above—and this can have subtle or significant effects on the way you’re treated. Sexually speaking, you may not even be seen as having erotic needs and physical capabilities. Some activists are working for better access to support and information regarding all things sexual for people with disabilities. This is a particularly challenging issue in the cases of developmental, intellectual, or “invisible” disabilities like traumatic brain injury or epilepsy.

In other cases, the sexual capacity of a person with a disability might have been eroded by the physical changes that come with their disability—this is especially true in cases of illness or injury—and the biggest challenge is re-learning what your body can do and feel.

At this point sexologists step in to say that the sexual experiences of the differently abled and people with disabilites have much to teach everyone. For one thing, as noted above, each person who is not at this moment disabled can be thought of as temporarily abled—some may be rendered disabled later, so disability rights and issues are relevant to all of us. In addition, we’ve learned a lot about the erotic potential of the body and brain. People whose spinal cords have been severed can still experience orgasm via stimulation of the earlobes or face; some individuals affected by neurological difficulties like fibromyalgia may not be able to tolerate light touch, but find some BDSM practices bypass that sensitivity and give them great pleasure. The differences among people with disabilities and differently abled people may be the source of ongoing scientific discovery about all of our bodies and the way they function.

Even in the here and now, the ways people experience and explore their sexuality can give all of us a hint at the varying ways to find and savor pleasure. There is no one single “normal” way for a body to be configured or to respond sexually, and any person, in any body, can find ways to feel pleasure and intimacy if they want to—especially if social barriers are removed. This also means that if you’re temporarily abled and find yourself attracted to someone whose abilities don’t match yours, your journey of exploration with them may be different than it would be with a partner who has a more conventional physicality—but we are all different, and it is always a journey.

The phrase “altered function” is used in a health care context; though it’s relevant to much more than disability, that phrase carries an expectation of a status quo, as well as a change to it. This could be the prior state of a person with a disability, which has been altered by illness or trauma. It could also refer to a social status quo that people with disabilities aren’t perceived as meeting. We must be vigilant for signs of “ableism” here, because where there’s ableism, there’s often discrimination and bias. Not only that, but ableism carries with it a sometimes profound inability to acknowledge the ways in which people with disabilities may have had to learn more about the body than many “able” people. Disabled sexologist Robert Morgan Lawrence notes, “Disabled folk often consider other disabled folk as better partners because of their ability to identify patience, difference and the definitions of what sex is as a creative process. We are sexual, even if some people don’t have the skill to identify what we do as sex.”

One source of altered function, ironically, is the medication that some individuals are prescribed by their doctors. While these may be required to maintain functionality, they can also change it—when it comes to sex, sometimes for the worse, as when medication causes sexual side effects like troubles with arousal or orgasm, or blood flow, fatigue, and problems like stomach aches, constipation and acid reflux, which can affect positions and comfort levels. Meds can also react synergistically to cause problems—and even trips to the emergency room. Every person should speak to their doctor and caregivers about pharmaceutical side effects of each medicine on its own as well as in combination with other drugs. If you have more than one doctor prescribing medication for different ailments, make sure those docs are put in touch with each other and that each knows what the other is prescribing. Also, don’t be shy about asking your pharmacist to double-check this.





Effects on Sexual Functioning


We don’t have enough space in this book, in which we are trying to cover most bases of sexuality, to go into great detail about all the various kinds of disability and their sexual repercussions. However, there are particular disabilities that have more or less predictable effects on sexual functioning; we’re going to briefly look at some of these here.





Neurological—referring to the nerves:


Spinal cord injury: The spinal cord is the superhighway that sends nerve impulses from all parts of the body to the brain—and back again. These impulses are responsible for virtually all bodily movement and sensation, so when the spinal cord is injured, everything below the site of injury can be affected. Sexual as well as mobility effects are common, and mobility can in turn affect a person’s sexual abilities, such as what positions they can assume and whether they can hold and use a sex toy. Spinal cord patients can find that other parts of their body become highly erotic, even if the genitals no longer feel sexual sensation.

Cerebral palsy: Often called CP, this usually appears at birth or early in life, and can result in movement disorders, unusual posture, stiff or floppy limbs, and issues with coordination. It can (but doesn’t always) affect intellectual function and speech. It doesn’t generally worsen over time, however, as some disorders do. It doesn’t always directly affect sexual functioning (except, sometimes, posturally), but some people with CP experience chronic pain, and there is some incidence of genital numbness or altered sensation. Some may also have a hard time holding sex toys, effectively touching themselves during masturbation, and finding a comfortable position.

ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease): ALS affects the brain and spinal cord’s motor neurons, which gradually die and can progressively affect muscle function and movement. ALS doesn’t directly cause sexual dysfunction, but can alter the body in significant enough ways that sexuality is impacted—by weakness, body image issues, muscle pain and loss of control, and other effects. ALS in its advanced stages becomes a mobility issue if paralysis sets in. As with CP, hand grasping can be affected with both sex toys and directed touch.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS): An autoimmune disease that involves the breakdown of the nerves’ insulating myelin sheaths, MS can affect both functioning and sensation. Sensory changes can include genital numbness, pain, or an increased sensitivity that’s not at all erotic. Erectile, orgasm and arousal problems, decreased vaginal tone and lubrication, and problems with fatigue, muscle spasms, and bladder control can also affect sex.





Mobility/movement:


Some ailments or physical changes/differences that result in mobility impairment do not cause direct sexual problems or even pain, but can cause difficulty moving from a wheelchair (if the person uses one) to a bed, lying down, or other positional changes that affect a person’s ability to have sex. Sometimes these conditions, regardless of their cause, can also make it difficult for an affected person to move their hands and arms, which may even affect their ability to masturbate. Many people with mobility-related issues have the support of a caregiver, sometimes a family member but often someone who is hired to support the person’s access to meals, travel outside their residence, bathing and other hygiene, and so forth. When a caregiver is also a sexual partner, sexual access may be arranged relatively easily, but an ongoing discussion in the disability, medical, and caregiver communities is how to support a person’s sexual needs especially when they have no partner.





Continence:


Some illnesses and disabling conditions, including problematic outcomes from bowel or bladder surgery, affect a person’s ability to control feces or urine. It’s always a good idea to empty bowel and bladder before a sexual encounter, and afterwards too, since urination helps maintain urethral cleanliness, especially important after sex involving penetration for all people. People for whom incontinence is an issue can use disposable pads underneath them when they have partner sex or masturbate.





Chronic pain:


Pain can be a result of accident, degenerative conditions, as well as an effect of drug withdrawal and many other health problems. It can sometimes even be an after-effect of surgery, which we think of as a fix for pain. In most cases the pain is not specific to the genitals (or even felt there); in fact, many people find that sexual arousal and orgasm help alleviate chronic pain. Not all pain is the same—the muscle pains of fibromyalgia are likely different from those of a person suffering from a musculoskeletal injury. In the former case, warming up and stretching might help more, and in the latter case, the body’s position might make more of a difference. A fibro patient might not be able to tolerate certain kinds of touch, and is likely to have flare-ups during which pain symptoms are increased. Rheumatoid conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus) attack the body, especially the joints, with painful inflammation, and this has further implications for positioning, grasping, and so on.

Pain medications are part of managing disabling conditions, but can be a double-edged sword; besides side effects that can include nausea and headaches, opioids can themselves be associated with sexual dysfunction, possibly because long-term use disrupts the body’s endocrine system. Their use can also lead to addiction and other undesirable physical changes, including constipation, itself not exactly a pro-sexual condition! At least one study has also linked commonly-used non-opioid pain meds, the NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) with erectile dysfunction, and anything that results in erectile dysfunction in people with penises may also cause arousal issues in people with clitorises. NSAIDs are one problem; steroid use, too, is associated with sexual problems, including the kind of anabolic steroids that might be used outside a medical context—in athletics, for example.

Multidisciplinary pain management may include pain medications including medical marijuana, physical therapy, and avoiding pain via positioning and body movement strategies—clearly these can be relevant to sexual functioning—plus psychotherapy. Because chronic pain can cause depression, the decision may be made to add anti-depressants to the mix, though it should be remembered that this category of medication often results in sexual issues too, and it’s worth asking whether depression resulting from a clear, perhaps temporary, life experience—illness, loss of a partner, family member, pet or job, etc.—is in fact comparable to the brain chemistry imbalance that these meds were developed to treat.





Illness:


Many kinds of organic illness can affect our sexuality. Cancer can affect genital organs and other parts of the body that are relevant to sex, including the uterus, ovaries, penis, testicles, prostate, anus, mouth and throat, and breasts; cancer treatments can be invasive and both these and the cancer can cause significant pain and fatigue, so a person with cancer has a good chance of having their sex life affected in one or multiple ways. Body image can change with cancer treatment, including its effects like hair loss and mastectomy. A cancer survivor’s partner can also be affected, sometimes losing their willingness to stay sexually connected to the person with cancer.

Heart attack (or an ongoing heart condition) can affect not only a person’s ability to exert themselves, as some sexual play requires; it also can, ironically, impair people (including partners) via fear of such exertion. As Boston Scientific notes, many people climb stairs without worrying, but are deeply concerned about resuming their sex lives after a heart attack. (A person who does have trouble climbing stairs should be cautious about resuming intercourse; according to the American Heart Association, other heart patients have no increased risk.)

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that affects the secretory glands; it is perhaps best known for its effects on breathing, though it can affect other organs as well. Other pulmonary issues that affect breathing include COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and emphysema, polio, MS, and certain other conditions. The sexual response cycle can make breathing faster and/or deeper, so while these ailments may not directly affect the genitals at all, sexual abilities can still be impacted.

Diabetes is related to one’s ability to process blood sugar. What makes it an ailment related to sex and disability, however, is its effects on the circulatory and nervous system. Physical arousal is associated with healthy blood flow, especially to the genitals and to neural responses. Both of these can be impaired in advanced or untreated cases of diabetes, and erectile and orgasm problems can result.





Mental/emotional:


Mental health issues can impact desire, arousal, emotional experience, and the formation of partner bonds, and pharmacological treatment of mental illness can cause significant sexual problems as well.

As with developmental or intellectual disabilities, certain mental health issues may render a person unable to give consent.





Sexually specific disabilities:


Vulvodynia is chronic vulvar pain. This can be generalized, or specific to the introitus (entrance to the vaginal canal); called vulvar vestibulitis, this is burning pain or unpleasant sensitivity at the vaginal opening, or vestibule. In either case, the pain may be constant, intermittent, or associated with touch or certain kinds of sexual activities, such as intercourse. It’s not clear what causes this syndrome, if, indeed, any one thing does. Not all health care providers are knowledgeable about vulvodynia, and a person dealing with it may need to seek a doctor who does know about its treatment. Coping with this condition involves identifying any triggering activities or substances; avoiding pressure on the vulva; relieving pain through heat, cool baths or cold packs, relaxation, and medications; and physical therapy to work with pelvic floor muscles or controlling sensation via biofeedback. If vaginal ailments like yeast infections or vaginitis are the cause, treating them is important, but pay attention to any indications that you may be sensitive to the medications used to treat these conditions.

Surgery can be suggested as a treatment for vulvar vestibulitis. However, it’s important to work with a health care provider who knows about the condition and is open-minded about treatments. One women’s care organization, for instance, has seen cases of vulvar vestibulitis in women who are dehydrated; are having intercourse when insufficiently lubricated; have allergies or sensitivities; and who are dealing with significant stress. We always suggest the least invasive and most holistic ways of dealing with a health issue.

Vaginismus is vaginal pain, specifically that which occurs from an involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles, often when penetration is attempted. It’s associated with anxiety—understandably!—but it’s not known which causes which. It isn’t psychosomatic: even if it has an emotional cause, in whole or part, it does involve an uncontrollable muscle spasm. But pain or discomfort may cause the spasm; some people with vaginismus have untreated vaginal infections. Kegels and desensitization, support in saying yes and no to penetration, and using graduated-size dildos can help with this condition. And of course it’s important to treat any underlying physical cause and, if a history of abuse is part of the equation, getting help for that can also make a difference.

Crotch injuries can occur in people of any gender. Bicycle or motorcycle accidents that result in a person hitting the bike’s central bar are a common cause, but sports injuries, kicks or other impacts can also result in crotch pain and sexual dysfunction. One prominent erotic star of the 1990s was open about having sustained such an injury, which left her unable to orgasm via clitoral stimulation and more interested in vaginal stimulation. Nerve damage can result from this type of accident, and chronic pain is a possibility as well.

Erectile dysfunction isn’t always a disability per se, but it can definitely be an adjunct to some disabling conditions and illnesses. In some cases, the Viagra/Cialis/Levitra family of drugs can restore erectile functioning, but other people may use a medically-prescribed penis pump like the Osbun Device, others use an injected medication called alprostadil (Caverject), and some opt for a penile implant.





Sex & Your Doctor


A number of years ago the Kinsey Institute released the results of a study they’d done asking US residents where they would go for sex advice and help if they needed it. Many sorts of helping professionals were cited, from sex therapists to pastors. But more than any other source of support they’d rely on, respondents said they’d visit their doctor.

Perhaps since then, with the advent of readily available information on the Internet, people are solving their own sex dilemmas—and hopefully they are accessing correct information. But we are left with the impression that many people continue to rely on their physician’s know-how, or at least they would if they could get up the nerve to ask about sex. More recent research has suggested that patients may be waiting for their doc to bring it up, and if your doctor never asks you about your sexual functioning, they are losing out on an opportunity to not only help you make sense of any sexual issues you may have, but also to evaluate your overall health through the lens of your sexual response. Many of these silent docs, it turns out, are waiting for their patient to bring up the topic.

No matter what your age, relationship status, or sexual orientation and interests, you should be able to speak to your physician about sexuality and gender identity without fear. If your health-care team is anything other than professional about these discussions—if they are homophobic, for example, or refuse to believe the bruise on your butt was the result of a much-desired, consensual spanking and not abuse—you deserve a different medical experience.

From one viewpoint, it is not your doctor’s fault. Your doc likely grew up in the same culture as the rest of us, and got no better basic sex education than you or I. And the sex education may not have been much better in a rigorous medical school curriculum. Many doctors get very little training in sexual and gender issues unless they are specialists, and much of what they do get has to do with reproductive issues. You’ll notice that this is one common aspect of sex that we barely cover in this book, because there is much greater focus on it out in the wide world. If you have a fertility or contraceptive question, your doctor can likely do a good job helping you; we’ll add some resources in our For Further Reading section too.

But let’s say for the sake of argument that you do have a problem talking frankly and comfortably with your doctor. If you’re too reticent to do the talking, please take responsibility for this and find a way to ask your question! Write it down in advance if you need to, or enlist a friend or partner to go to the doctor with you and help you get the words out. Your physician is not a mind-reader, and they cannot just look at you or check your blood pressure and know for sure that you’ve been having erectile problems lately or your orgasms have stopped feeling as good as they used to.

If it’s your doc who has the problem, you have two choices: Find a new medical care team! A doctor (or office staff) who cannot behave in a professional manner does not exactly deserve your business. But if you value them in every other way, you can choose to communicate clearly about your disappointment, and educate them as to your sexual or gender identity and your needs. Of course not everyone is up for doing this—and it should not have to be your job. In a perfect world, the sexuality and gender curriculum in every medical school would be diverse, sex-positive, and thorough. But until that day, people learn when they have to learn and, sometimes, when they are asked to learn. If you are frank with your doc about the ways you expect to be addressed and the kind of information you need your health care team to have, you will be helping future patients too. For a thorough and empowering discussion of our communication with our doctors, sexologist/MD Dr. Charles Moser’s book Health Care Without Shame is a must-read. And don’t forget to share all your prescription information with your MD, since drug side effects and interactions are one common source of health problems, including sexual ones.





Sex Surrogate Therapy


Any form of disability can be associated with depression, anxiety, body image issues, difficulty finding partners, and sexual avoidance. Many involve chronic or breakthrough pain, movement and positioning issues, and sexual response or orgasm limitations either associated with the condition itself or with medications taken to treat it. All this adds up to one thing: people with disabilities or who are differently abled, whether temporarily or permanently, need sex information and support as much or more than anyone else—and their partners do, too. When they do not have sex partners, some have availed themselves of the services of sexual surrogates, also known as surrogate partners. Surrogate therapy, in which a trained person takes the client through a series of sessions to teach and practice physical and sexual exercises, under the guidance of a therapist, can be a helpful step toward a satisfying sexual life, especially for a person with a disability. The surrogate supports that person’s right to a sex life and helps them understand and learn to communicate any specific needs they may have, so they can talk about these with future partners.

Surrogate partners are professionals who are usually referred by a therapist; surrogacy information is also accessible via the Internet. The International Professional Surrogates Association (IPSA) trains and certifies its members; other organizations can also be found online. IPSA’s website surrogatetherapy.org clearly explains their mission and their approach, stating it is based on the “successful methods of Masters and Johnson. In this therapy, a client, a therapist and a surrogate partner form a three-person therapeutic team…These therapeutic experiences include partner work in relaxation, effective communication, sensual and sexual touching, and social skills training. Each program is designed to increase the client’s knowledge, skills, and comfort.”

A person with a disability may or may not choose to work with a surrogate, but they definitely need a health care team that is not only aware of disability issues, including the latest information on their specific disability, but also able to talk frankly and comfortably about sexuality and strategize with their patient for best-case access to information, partners, family communication, and pro-sexual strategies. No person should have health care providers who are not comfortable with sexual functioning, but people with disabilities may need a sex-positive doctor or care team even more than any other kind of person with a sexual question or issue.

The late Mark O’Brien, who lived most of his life in an iron lung due to childhood polio, wrote extensively about his experiences with sexual surrogacy, on which the movie The Sessions is based. O’Brien was assisted by a team of sex-positive caregivers in finding and seeing a surrogate partner (see our resource list). The surrogate with whom he worked, Cheryl Cohen-Greene, has also written a memoir.





Assistive Toys & Items to Help Get Your Pleasure On


People with disabilities use sex toys for the same reasons as anyone: for pleasure, variety, and experimentation. Many people also use some kind of assistive devices or tools in daily life: from the expensive and complex like a motorized wheelchair to items small and simple like a mounted can opener—all are precious to those that need them. So why suffer when it comes to sex? Sex toys themselves assist with sexual difficulties or physical, mental or sensory impairments. These can be seen as comparable to other assistive devices used by people with disabilities. In addition to the toys themselves there are fabulous inventions that assist with sex or in using your sex toy: Find the pillow, strap, sling, extender or other device that will help you.

To look for these items online, try doing a search for phrases like “sex toy assist” or “assistive devices for sex.” Another term frequently used in the adult industry is “sex furniture,” or “position furniture.” We point this one out for you to use as a search tool since that phrase evokes images of sofas and armchairs! In fact, many assistive devices are simple, such as firm pillows in wedge or crescent shapes, used for getting into certain positions, or rocking during sex. Some pillows hold a vibrator, including the Magic Wand, in place so it can be used “hands-free.” Some pillows are made so that a dildo can protrude from them and be mounted. Holders for penis sleeves allow these toys, too, to be hands-free. Long handles can extend a vibrator’s reach; vibes with remote controls prevent you from having to reach or fiddle with small buttons; and various other helpful inventions have been created by someone who might be very much like you!





Dating, Mating and Relating



Stages and Ages: Sexuality for a Lifetime


Let’s jump into a time machine and take a ride across life. But instead of getting out to meet the future or past you, let’s just keep our faces pressed against the bubble glass and consider some of the phases of our lives with sexual health and happiness in mind.

We call this section “Stages and Ages” because not everyone experiences the same things at the same times in their lives. Some people discover their sex drive at 15 and others at 45. Some people come out as gay or lesbian at 12 and some at 20, 40, or 60. Child-rearing can begin as a teenager or in a person’s 40s, and for some men, decades later. Millions of people choose to not raise children at all, so that’s not even part of their life “stages.” Some issues we present could happen at any age, depending on your sexual experiences, while others are more specific to your chronological age, like hormone fluctuations, and even that can vary from person to person. So while we take this ride, bear all that in mind. Our intention is that you learn about these phases for yourself, and so you can be a better ally, friend, or family member because you have a better understanding of them.

The Teen Years—Welcome to the roller coaster! Once puberty hits and our hormones surge, we’re on a biologically-influenced trip: Mother Nature’s manipulation to make us reproduce. Evolutionary psychology is big on this idea and sometimes attributes everything about human sexuality to it, often ignoring sexual diversity. There’s no question that physical changes in our teenage years can set us up to want sex and/or partnership, to pair-bond, sometimes over and over and over again, and in some cases to get an early start on reproducing the species. But other young people grow up not wanting sex at all, or at least not heterosexual intercourse, and maybe not even sex with another person. They might have overwhelming crushes or an active fantasy life, but not act on them physically. Another developmental step that keeps teens busy is the need to differentiate from their parents, to become their own men, women, and otherwise gendered young adults.

This is the age when some are trying to figure out who to date and how to date, or how to avoid dating anyone at all! Birth control, safer sex, and vaccines all require attention and decisions. Sexual orientation issues may come up, and young people learn how to express desire and say no as well as yes.

Social media is so inextricably intertwined with daily life now that young people might not realize it’s a new human experience to which we have not had reasonable time to adapt. The things we read about ourselves on this overwhelming info feed can affect self-esteem, the dating pool, breaking up, gossip, and loyalty—having bad experiences online can contribute to depression, or self-destructive acts, even suicide. If you, or someone you know, is stuck in this kind of loop, get help!

If we could have a wish come true it would be for young people coming into your own sexuality to unplug your self-image from social media altogether and embrace going slowly, enjoying the roller coaster ride of crushes, love and longing—trust us, when things even out you may well miss the wild ride you’re on right now, the exploration that allows you to discover your own unique body and desires, your own sexual mores and attitudes. Be inquisitive: there’s always more to learn!

The 20s—Sex in this decade is frequently focused on two primary issues: establishing one’s own adult sexual interests and habits (the sort of people you’re most attracted to, where you like to meet them, what kind of sex you like to have with them), usually including some focus on experimentation, at least in fantasy or imagination; and learning how to be with a partner, including an increasing ability to be intimate and to communicate.

This period of life can be affected by the kind of sexual, and gender role, myths and beliefs you carry into young adulthood and how or if those ideas are challenged now that you are “out in the world.” This may mean that your 20s are also a time of overcoming misinformation, sexual shame, fear, or shyness. When communication isn’t good with partners or the wrong kind of partners are chosen, it can set up a lifetime of relationship issues, at least until time, maturity, and sometimes the counsel of a therapist or a new, more appropriate partner helps resolve those challenges.

People in their 20s who read and use this book are not only going to benefit by having more knowledge, but also more confidence. By simply being proactive and saying, “Sexual intimacy and health are important to me. I care for myself,” you are giving your sex life attention, and attention helps us flourish. Self-care—whether it’s eating right or sexual health—doesn’t always come easy, so to you we say Bravo!

The 30s—Many sex books state that the 30s represent the peak of women’s sexual experience, while the poor guys get the best sex of their lives in their late teens. But this, we think, needs to be unpacked. While there may be some physiological reasons that women often blossom in their 30s, we are much more inclined to think it has to do with their achieving real comfort and a sense of identity as an adult, sexual woman, and having matured enough to make smarter relationship choices—whether this means they have developed real comfort and confidence in a long-term relationship or because they’ve left more dysfunctional partnerships behind. The same thing can happen with males—maybe their testosterone is higher when they’re 18, but that isn’t all it takes to make for good sex, and men, too, may find that sex as a mature person, with a partner with whom they can communicate well, is better than any sex they’ve had before. People of any and every gender might find easier access to more and better information, their sense of sexual shame may be lessened—and we hope everyone has also accumulated a few new social skills!

Some people will have started a family some time during their 20s or 30s, which can definitely affect libido—because of hormones in the case of giving birth, or fatigue in the case of any child-rearing, regardless of whether you’re the birth parent. On the other hand, having kids, like many other major life events (including the death of a loved one) can be an impetus for valuing every moment of life and making any changes needed in order to do so. Major life events can actually help with sexual pleasure; some will find a new foundation in their lives, or a new commitment to Carpe Diem, even if part of the time they are mourning.

The 40s—This is the decade when most women’s hormonal levels begin to fluctuate and some women enter perimenopause. A few authorities think something similar happens with men as well. As we know, hormones are a big deal as far as sexual functioning is concerned, and sometimes people in their 40s find it hard to age gracefully (sexually speaking); they might be working extremely hard, consolidating money for their kids’ school funds, retirement or just to make ends meet; they might also be dealing with career advancement; so stress, limited free time, and a sedentary lifestyle can make it tough to stay as sexually engaged and active as they were when they were younger, childless, or lower on the career ladder. Perimenopause often doesn’t happen until your late 40s and a lot of people think this is the best time of life.

It’s important to recognize that we can’t afford to give in to the idea that changes that disengage us from sex are just inevitable aspects of aging. When we do that, it’s only a couple of steps to thorny relationship issues. Also, if you think you’re aging now, whoa, just wait a couple of decades for The Real Thing! Besides, the 40s can be a person’s best years as far as sex and relationships are concerned.

The fact is that people who exercise and stay healthy and communicative, prioritizing their relationships and the role of sex within them, often go through their 40s having great sex. This brings us to two attitudes that are crucial in this decade: One is to emphasize good health, relationship connections and yes, sex! Let sex be/stay important. The second is to let go of judging how you have sex now, including physical and time limitations, and enjoy: your body’s sensations, either during solo time or with a partner, the wonderful contact with another person that lovemaking provides, and the self-knowledge that comes with accumulated years and also the self-exploration that bodily changes sometimes evoke. Keeping a focus on better health and sex helps you let go of any judgments that your body, and your partner’s, are not twenty years young anymore (and don’t forget, some twenty-year-olds had way-less-than-positive sexual experiences). During aging, you often find you’re ahead of the game! You know more (about sex and communication in general, and about your own body and sexual desires in particular); you’ve matured in terms of your expectations of relationships (we hope!); and time and experience do their thing to help you understand what you really want, not just in terms of sex acts, but the way you want sex and relationship/s to interconnect.

The 50s—Let’s start with an “old-fashioned” life cycle: you’re married or partnered, and/or had children, and your kids left home. Some people’s lives do not follow this track, and some kids take a very long time to leave! Empty-nesters, especially those couples in which a woman is into menopause and no longer has to watch out for getting pregnant (if she has been in a heterosexual partnership), often experience a sexual renaissance in their 50s.

Many people, of course, never have kids, and may not have partnered or remained with a live-in lover or spouse. Yet others may have had kids later in life or welcomed elderly relatives into their home, so the nest is by no means empty.

Other people’s sexual reawakening may occur courtesy of a divorce or other form of parting when a relationship has grown too stale to revive, or was never positive in the first place.

Some women find it easier to continue a vibrant sex life if they ease through their menopausal transition with hormone replacement therapy; others change their diets and go natural. Communication remains key here because some couples, and uncoupled folk as well, find the aging process really does affect what they can or want to do sexually, but unless relationship problems and/or poor health are part of a 50+ person’s reality, sex can remain important and fabulous for decades.





Young & Old: Allies in Pleasure and Dignity


If you are reading this next section as someone younger than 70, consider the kind of life that you hope to have for yourself at that age. Now go a step further by embracing the adage, “treat others how you want to be treated.” Seniors can easily lose power over their own lives; we hope to help by increasing awareness so you can stand up for elders in your life, whether they are people you love, work or volunteer with. For example, if you are moving a parent into an assisted living community, will they have privacy? How is dating handled? Do they have freedom over their bodies? Who has access to the place where they might keep lubricants or sex toys? No matter where they live, do they need any assistance getting access to any supplies they might want? Assistance in making friends or dates, getting to and from senior lunches or community events?





The 60s—Many people remain active as they age, sexually and otherwise: some might still be working, are socially and/or politically involved, and have fulfilling sex lives. Some are coupled, with both partners still going strong; others are single or divorced, navigating the vicissitudes of contemporary dating rituals that involve logging on and figuring out what to write in an online profile, not to mention how to sort responses or get someone else to reply in the first place.

Some, however, tend to become more reclusive as they age, and see old friends less and less. Oftentimes disease and death of one or more close friends, possibly even a romantic partner or spouse, has happened by now. Those who are retired or work at home might rarely meet anyone new. The thought of online dating horrifies them; additionally, they might find themselves either not terribly interested in sex, reluctant to reveal their aging body to someone new, or unattracted to people their own age.

Many older people came of age, sexually speaking, before vibrators and other toys became popular; when sex meant love and marriage; and when little sex information was available and the topic almost verboten. Not all, but many of these people were too busy raising families and living traditional lives to pay attention to changing sexual mores, so these cultural changes sailed past them almost unnoticed; now that they’re in their 60s or older, to radically alter entrenched sexual attitudes and activities would take a mighty effort.

It may be that this effort is more than worthwhile, and many people graduate from middle age determined to make it, or to revitalize their sex lives with long-term partners. For some, retirement isn’t a signal that worldly activity is over and the next stop is a care center; it means there’s more time for travel, creative pursuits, and exploring all kinds of deferred pleasures, including slow and sensuous romance. If there’s one generalization to make about sex in one’s 60s and beyond, in fact, it’s “slow is the way to go” since full arousal can take longer, direct touch is often necessary to optimize turn-on (including erections), and it may ebb and flow more than in a person’s younger years. This isn’t a bad thing; it can mean that languorous lovemaking will finally get its due.

The 70s and onward—In our youth-focused culture it can be hard to find role models and reminders that sex is a pleasure enjoyed by the old as well as the young, and many people become increasingly sensitive as they age to the lack of respect and acknowledgement society gives elders’ sexuality. Frank Sinatra’s hit wasn’t “Hello, Old Lovers,” after all—though wouldn’t it send a sweet and positive message if it had been? Increasing attention is being paid to single seniors these days, whether widowed or divorced, who continue to have sex even in elder care facilities. Whether or not they have a song to sing about it, new and existing relationships may definitely continue to have a sexual element; older people may continue to masturbate; and the physical connection with another person’s body may be desired, and missed if it’s absent. Safer sex education is a new and significant challenge for some active elders, who may have received zero information about condoms and lubricants at other stages in their lives, but may be exposed to STIs in their newly-explored sexual freedom. Some facilities are stepping up with classes and other services, but among some families—and care center staffs—it’s an unexpected challenge when one’s Grandma finds a girlfriend or boyfriend at the “old folks’ home” and may struggle to understand and accept the role that sex can continue to play for older relatives or residents.

LGBTQQ elders, in particular, may be impacted in their sexual or partnering options by advancing age. Some may never have been out to their families; some people have been out and proud, but find they have no access to a queer-positive care center if they need one, and they may even go back into the closet in their later years. SAGE is a national social service and advocacy organization dedicated to LGBTQQ seniors that may provide useful resources for elders and their families.




You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.

Virginity


Some people are excited and nervous about losing their virginity, and others think, “Why isn’t it just over with already!?” Those with the latter attitude might want to “get it over with” to satisfy their curiosity, or to fit in with friends, or because they have an active non-intercourse sex life with a partner and want to add to the activities they are already doing. People who think the former way have various reasons, too, including their own ideals inherited from society, their parents, the culture around them, which may or may not include a religious basis to emphasize virginity. Indulging oneself in a special rite of passage can create good memories. And in our culture it’s perfectly fine to just go about your business and not make a big deal of it. Either way, it’s your choice—or in any case, it should be, although we acknowledge that for some people it was not possible. We invite you to embrace other sorts of virginity that may be yours to “lose” when you desire.

We begin with the presumption that in reading this chapter you are curious about virginity and its “loss” for yourself, not just wanting to please a partner. Virginity is still very important in some communities and subcultures, in some families, and to some people, and often is “saved” for someone special: if not for the person one is going to marry, then at least a first love, or someone who’s trusted or meaningful to you in some other way. For others, losing virginity is just one step on a life-path, and doesn’t carry the same weight as falling in love or getting hitched. And there are many “firsts” that will be remembered and, we hope, cherished—not just first contact of penis and vagina, or whatever primary virginity loss might mean to you. What will make one moment or act special is between the two or more people sharing the experience. Simply gazing into someone’s eyes and knowing they are thinking about you the way you are thinking about them can send tingles down your spine—and the very first time in your life it happens, it can almost make you think you’ll explode. There’s first time kissing, or touching, or masturbating in front of someone, and of course first orgasm. For those who had no choice in their first sexual touching it’s a re-birth to come back and make virgin firsts of their own empowered choosing.

So let’s decide what we are talking about here, shall we? Mostly, virginity is defined in terms of sexual intercourse, and “losing your virginity” is generally defined as penis-in-vagina sex for the first time. For many, this brings up concerns about pain, which can occur upon breaking the hymen. The hymen is a membrane that may or may not partially cover the inner opening of the vagina: may or may not. Many women do not have a hymen intact enough to even see or feel by the time they have intercourse for the first time. It stretches and disappears over time during many common activities.

Sex does not always hurt the first time, since women have differently shaped hymens. Some have become stretched out before the hymen-owner has intercourse for the first time. Some people have hymens that are visible if their labia are spread open enough. Another reason sex may or may not hurt depends on how aroused you are before insertion, a variable that affects those with hymens and without.

Being super turned on before any intercourse happens is always best. For those whose hymens are partially intact it’s even more important. Have lots and lots of sex (remember, we don’t define sex as intercourse) before intercourse so that you are very turned on. If you are one of the few who has a partially intact hymen that will tear or stretch a lot, it might sting a little from the saltiness of your own juices or lubricant. Is the pain worse than a paper cut? No. It’s brief. Remember that sexual intercourse can be painful for anyone who is not turned on, whether it’s their first time or 500th. That has nothing to do with hymens!





Sex With the Lights On


Have you and a lover ever disagreed on lighting in the boudoir? Maybe you want to see what’s going on and your partner wants it pitch black, or maybe it’s the other way around. Hang in there—we have some suggestions that might make both of you feel better.





Body Image


First let’s acknowledge that we live in a society in which even some stereotypically gorgeous women (and some people of every other gender too!) feel their looks are flawed. Body image is a serious issue that can affect sexuality. We all deserve to think of ourselves as worthy of erotic attention (if we want it). When self-consciousness is fraught with bad feelings or worries, that’s not just an argument over the lights or dealing with your partner; this is impacting your sexual pleasure and comfort.

Think about approaching sex. Do you feel a sense of “Ahh, that’s going to be relaxing.” Or “Yum yum, gimme some!” Or does your body tense up and your mind start whirling with self-conscious thoughts? If you said “Yes” to the last question then you can begin to understand how this is affecting you.

When someone doesn’t like the lights on, it’s a clue that they feel shy about their body. Encouraging words could help lure such a person out of their shell. Men feel this way too—we know a guy who kept his shirt on all the time, even in bed. Shame or pressure won’t work, but supportive and sexy talk might.

How you dress can help too. Women don’t just wear lingerie in bed because their partners think it’s sexy; most who wear it also think it’s hot, but just as importantly, it helps us present ourselves in a way that gives us confidence. Shar’s book The Femme’s Guide to the Universe has been a self-esteem tome for thousands of people of all shapes and sizes, leaving them not just comforted but pumped up and super sexy. And we said “lingerie,” but there are also masculine-of-center modes of dress that evoke sexiness and banish self-consciousness.





Back to Lighting


Here’s a compromise: Keep the lights low but not off…gradually work toward turning up the rheostat so your loveliness can be revealed.

Candlelight has been a lover’s best friend since the beginning of time. It makes anyone’s skin glow, gives the partner who wants to see a little light to go on, yet it’s not glaring. Today’s technology also offers swirling light apps for your personal electronic devices that go along with music. We hope sexy garb and lighting will take care of most shyness: By the time you’re ready to undress you’re turned on enough to forget the voice in your head that hisses, “You’re not sexy enough!” Yes, you are! If you get as far as erotic play with someone else, that’s clearly a vote in your favor!





When It’s Shame


Sometimes it’s more than feeling unsexy about our bodies. Some people have deep shame in their background. They are uncomfortable being seen as a sexual person, period. When that’s the case, shame must be addressed. Whether it’s the result of a rigidly conservative background, emotionally abusive people in your life, or negative personal experiences, shame erodes one’s ability to feel comfortable in one’s body and sexuality. It can be toxic on a lifelong basis unless it’s addressed.

Dr. Carol Queen’s work has helped many people overcome these issues. Her book Exhibitionism for the Shy is dedicated to boosting confidence and helping us feel empowered and comfortable with our bodies and sexuality. It’s filled with suggestions that are fun, thoughtful and doable.





Finding Partners (And Deciding What to Do With Them Once You’ve Got Them)


To Mate or Not to Mate


Before we even get into finding the kind of partner/s that will mesh with you, let’s acknowledge that some people don’t want to mate at all. Most of us are surrounded by partnered people. You may be partnered yourselves. It really is a norm in our culture to connect the desire for sex with that for love and partnership; even though many of us go through a period of more casual sex , others probably assume (and you might share that assumption) that one day we will “settle down.” Popular culture is saturated with this idea; after all, “love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.”

The thing is, we have it on good authority that some horses would prefer to run free, not be hitched to a conveyance. And some human beings really are not the marrying kind, and are either not interested in anything long-term or live-in, or don’t fare very well once they get there. We can’t tell you which kind of person you are, and it’s worth remembering that partnering skills can be learned (and they are skills—the mere desire for a partner is not enough for a successful relationship). We have said many times that people are not only diverse sexually, but in their partnering styles—and it’s worth saying in so many words that one perfectly acceptable style is “single by choice.” This choice lasts for a lifetime for some, a decade for others, and maybe only a few days for someone else. You might have said or heard “I am done with love,” or some version of that sentiment, but that’s not what we’re talking about here; oftentimes someone who’s not interested in mating has thought about their choices and made a decision without the immediate influence of a bad breakup or relationship.

Not desiring a partner is not the same thing as being asexual—plenty of asexual people do want to partner, just not sexually. It can involve casual sex or none at all, or friendly ongoing connections that are never defined as “partnering.” Many people live rich, fulfilling lives without having a primary partner, and some of us simply seem to be so wired in to our intellectual, creative, spiritual, or work pursuits that we have no room in our lives for a full-time mate.





Looking for Love, or at Least Sex


Where is the __________ for me?

All of the above

All of the above times 2



Young, old, and everywhere in between, people have their eye out for partners—love matches, quick bounces, their missing halves, anonymous tricks. And while maybe any human could have some sort of sex with any other human if open to the experience, there’s no doubt that most of us have a narrower range of desirable partner in mind—we’ve got our “type,” or we have a clear, or clear-ish, idea what we want from a relationship, whether short-term or ‘til death do us part.

We hope you have an idea of whom you’d like to date, have sex with, marry, or whatever it is you’re looking for. If you don’t have a clear image of that person’s qualities, you might not know them when you meet them, and you could go through quite a few wrongs before you get to a right. Of course, that’s your prerogative, but if relationships are hard to come by or you don’t like the experience once you find someone, start by asking yourself what you really want.

What kind of a relationship? What kind of sex do you want? How often? How will you know you’re loved? What are your expectations about living together? How will you spend your time? We could keep asking these kinds of questions for the next three chapters, because there are so many different ways people connect and establish relationships. Many people just want a partner, without thinking through the details of what that will look like, then feel overwhelmed or upset if their partner doesn’t share their own conscious or subconscious ideals about their lives together. Having said that, it’s worth asking yourself: Are you sure you do want a relationship? Many people want one because they think they’re supposed to want one, but for some of us, separating love and support (which you can get from friends and family) from sex and physical contact works better for us. Our culture is full of “love conquers all” rhetoric, and lots of unprepared people discover to their dismay that love doesn’t always. So at the very least, remember that maintaining a relationship takes actual skills. As with sex education, relationship education is another huge (and related) topic for which many of us just don’t get enough information and mentoring to prepare us. Not that it stops us!




You can’t get what you want / if you don’t know what you want.

	—Joe Jackson





So before you think about meeting someone—what kind of person do you want to meet? What kind of relationship do you hope to establish?

You can meet a partner just about anywhere, if you’re a socially comfortable person who connects easily with others and will follow up on attraction with an offer to spend more time with the person you’ve met. Some people use this outgoing nature to their advantage looking for sex partners—as one man we knew many years ago told us, “I have sex with a lot of people because I ask so many people I meet if they want to have sex. Most of them say no, and some are pretty pissed about it. But I ask so often that sometimes I get a yes, and it adds up.” And that was before the days of dating and hook-up apps that let you find willing partners without even going outside and striking up a conversation.

Maybe you’re not that guy—neither that comfortable asking perfect strangers if they want to get it on, nor interested in racking up conquests. If you have particular sexual interests—not necessarily numbers, but specific desires—perhaps you ought to go to the clubs or join groups where others with your interests hang out: the fetish scene, the BDSM dungeon, the exhibitionist parties. You’ll still need to know how to meet people, but part of the question of compatibility is solved up front when you start looking for a partner in a room full of people who are sexually sympatico (or at least in the ballpark).

There are quite a few aspects to sexual compatibility, and we’ve already given you a tool to think about who might be in your ballpark: the Three Lists. Use it to prioritize sexual activities that are especially important to you and to recognize no-go zones. You’ll still have to talk to prospective lovers and check out their moves, but knowing what you want helps you come from a place of strength when determining whether someone is right for you.





Good, Giving and Game


What makes a good lover? There are as many answers to that question as there are sexually active people, perhaps, but our friend Dan Savage has come up with a great, helpful concept: Good, Giving and Game.

“Good” means “good in bed”: you know enough about sex, you have erotic skills—and don’t worry, you can always add to your repertoire! But body-to-body contact requires you to pay some attention to your partner’s response, communicate, and sometimes bring all your hand-eye coordination to the fun at hand. “Giving” means you devote equal time to partners’ pleasure, not focusing mainly on your own. “Game” means that if your partner wants to do it, you’re up for trying it out—within reason. Anal sex without lube? Not within reason. Dressing up as Gaming characters? Oh, give it a whirl! Think about how you fare as far as these three G’s are concerned, and if you’re having issues with a partner, you might subject them to the same level of scrutiny. Because if each of us might strive to be Good, Giving and Game, it stands to reason that we deserve partners who reflect those qualities back at us.





But how about other kinds of compatibility? It might be worth making the Three Lists to sketch out other aspects of the person you want to meet. You don’t want to micromanage yourself out of the field, but you would do well to be clear with yourself about what you want and expect from a partner: how you wish to be treated, what kind of personality is compatible with yours, any deal-breaker qualities.

Then keep an eye out for people who fit the elements on your “yes” and “maybe” lists, and try to avoid tangling with those whose personal qualities illustrate your “no” list.

Where do you find them?

As we said: just about anywhere. They’re sitting next to you on the airplane, mixing you a drink at the bar, in your small group in speech class, at your old friend’s wedding, and working in the same company as your ex. And if you’re on good terms with your ex, you might even wrangle an introduction! Humans you might have a great time with are all around. But let’s say you want to double down on compatibility.

Think about what you love, what you care about, what you find most meaningful. The places you enjoy or value when alone are splendid places to look for someone who’ll enjoy them with you. It’s why Dear Abby counseled the lovelorn to look around at church, or to find a hobby. It’s why someone who loves hiking should join a hiking club and someone who’s passionate about politics should volunteer for their favorite candidate. And by the way, if you’re at all shy, this is especially useful. Here are some reasons why:

	 Whether or not you meet someone special, it’s intrinsically worthwhile to you to be there. You won’t be wasting your time.

If you don’t meet someone to date, you might meet new friends—and they in turn might know someone you’d get on with.

When you’re in a place or doing something you enjoy, you’re at your best and most engaged—you’re automatically more attractive to others.

You’ll always have something to chat about, even if you don’t like small talk.

You raise your chances of finding a person whose values match yours more closely than that random bartender or the person in the aisle seat on the plane.

You can see your attractive person in action and learn more about them and their interactions with others.



It’s good to “follow what fascinates you”—words Carol learned from a storyteller in college that literally helped shape her life. And it’s a great way to narrow down the populace to a bunch of people likely to share similar fascinations. Then you can determine who might be compatible with you sexually, socially, and relationship-wise.

Before we move on, let’s acknowledge that plenty of us have a propensity for (or at least a phase of) choosing the totally wrong person. Sometimes that’s even a plus! You learn what you want by ending up with someone who’s not that person; just as mediocre sex can inspire you to make sex better, the wrong partner can get you jazzed up to seek a more copacetic love. Sometimes they’re the wrong person as far as your beliefs and cultural background are concerned, but are right in other ways. Sometimes we choose the wrong partner (or a temporary, “We-know-this-isn’t-going-anywhere” person) to put up a boundary because we know we’re not ready for “the real thing” yet—whatever the real thing is to us. And don’t rule out chemistry: sometimes we fall in with someone due to raw animal attraction!





Lover’s Luck: What Makes You A Catch?


Finding someone you like and are attracted to who shares your worldview and wants the same things as you, and who likes and is attracted to you in return, is a best-case scenario. Many of us can identify people we find attractive, who we’d love to pursue, but the bells that rang for us when we saw them don’t ring for them. How do you get lucky? What are the elements of attractiveness?

To some degree this is ineffable, impossible to pin down. Interpersonal chemistry can be mysterious. But there are things that help your chances:

	 	 How do you look and present yourself? Cleanliness, grooming and style send a message; make sure it’s the one you want to send.

How are your social skills? Are you comfortable chatting with others? Can you make eye contact? Do you have a sense of the give and take of a conversation, and can you draw the other person out? Do you interrupt or monopolize, or answer questions in monosyllables?

Can you balance a conversation with a new person between revealing yourself and focusing on them—but without making them feel interviewed or on the spot?

Can you find topics of interest to talk about? Does your conversation partner seem equally interested?

How quickly do you move to expressing sexual interest? In some contexts, going there right away is appropriate and expected; most other times, not so much. If you seem interested in others primarily as potential sexual partners, it will be off-putting to those who want to go a little slower in getting to know someone.

Can you read their signals as to interest or resistance?

Do you seem desperate to meet a partner or get a date?

Do you send signals of respect? Are you clearly interested in them as a person?



Any of these can get in the way of our desire to meet, connect, date, have sex, begin a relationship. And all of them can be improved upon, or learned in the first place. If you don’t have as much luck as you’d like in the game of love, take an inventory from the list above; friends, family, life coaches and therapists can all help you do this, though beware of over-loyal family members who think you’re perfect, or, on the other hand, are overly critical. None of us is perfect, but we can move in that direction if we try.





OUR RULES


We’re aware that many people believe in marriage and monogamy—so do we, if that’s the right relationship style for you and your partner. We also know that many advisors insist this is the only partnering style anyone should ever accept. Have you heard the one about “not giving away the milk before they buy the cow”? We must say, that always sounded pretty sexist to us, not to mention possibly disrespectful to bovines. If no sex before marriage is your cup of tea, find a partner who wants the same, and hopefully enjoy your wedding night! But please do not manipulate others with your sexuality; our rules say “Be clear about your desires, expectations, and boundaries, and look for someone who says, ‘Oh, just what I always wanted!’” What about that phrase, “You complete me”? You don’t need an other half—you are a whole person already! Our rules say, “Look for a partner who’s ‘opposite’ you in every way if you want to, but make sure they are compatible in the ways that count. Human beings are not in fact like those love necklaces of a heart sawed in half.”





Real or Virtual?


The above information about finding partners assumes you have no other options but to use your frequent flyer miles to find that perfect specimen in seat 22D. But you don’t have to leave your town, your neighborhood, or even your house, as long as you have an Internet connection. Many partner-finding apps and sites will help you find others for dating and relating, whether they are in your area code or very long distance. Some people rely on fancy algorithms to ensure compatibility, then plan to meet in person; others engage in long, passionate, Internet-only affairs. Partner-finding websites come and go, but there are tons of them, and some have become very specific, so if this is an appealing idea, do some research and find the most appropriate places for you to strut your electronic stuff.

Some people love Internet dating and partner-finding because they are introverted or super-busy, appreciating the way the Internet allows them to compartmentalize. Asexuals may like the way such a relationship gives them access to love and intimacy without a physical, sexual connection. People with mobility challenges may find a world of love and friendship with an Internet connection. Those of us who love the written word may find a text-based affair exciting. And some of us let alternate personas out to play when we engage in web-based affairs. A word of caution to the latter type: Just remember the person on the other end may accept you as you represent yourself, and if you get increasingly close, this can box you in if you’ve introduced yourself as a different gender or with some other significant identity that doesn’t match the “real” you. We know these identities can feel or be entirely real for you, but look at it from your screen-mate’s point of view and ask yourself what their response might be if they met you in the flesh.





Consensual Partner-Seeking


If you strive to learn and practice good communication and relationship skills, be your best self, seek to learn from your experience and others around you what your preferred relational life might entail, look for compatible people, and are honest about your desires and expectations… you are on the right track for partnered happiness. There are no guarantees, and life lessons can be intense; circumstances can intervene; people can grow apart. But the couples who were not honest with one another to begin with, we assure you, have embarked on relationships with built-in fault lines. We ask you to know thyself because it’s valuable in and of itself to do this, but also so you can tell that news to other people when it looks like that third date is going to turn into an ongoing thing; or when a blinking cursor on a keyboard comes with another person looking at another screen somewhere, waiting to see what you are going to say. Put your real self out there, ask them to do the same, and see what kind of an adventure you two can cook up.





Consent & Its Discontents


Not so long ago, talk of “consent” was commonly heard in only one sexual or erotic context—that of BDSM. In a realm of sex play that can involve bondage, intensity, the possibility of pain, and dominant-submissive role-play, consent is crucial and has long been understood to be the cornerstone of the BDSM lifestyle. “Safeword” was the quintessential proof of consent, and when uttered, you were freed from the scene: All action would, or should, stop. But as we’ve been telling people for years, the BDSM world’s ideals of negotiation and consent ought to form the basis for all kinds of sexuality. Put another way, if they were basic to sex education and everyone’s understanding of sex, there would be more positive, satisfying sex and less sexual pain and trauma.

In that context there’s a moment—a clear moment—when erotic activity stops, at least long enough for partners to check in with each other; furthermore, those two (or more) people have already thought about, talked about, and planned their sexual encounter. Whether it’s BDSM or intercourse, there are many situations in which people who know each other well, and/or have been together in a sexual way before, can tell whether sex is a “yea” or “nay” just from their past experiences of each other before that moment. But past experience isn’t always a guide to whether something is desired and consensual in the present moment.

If you break down consent—really pull the concept apart and think about it—there are many steps to consider. We are offering our standards and sex ed pointers here, as always, and we encourage you to use this section as a steppingstone for creating conversations about standards for yourself as well as others.

You may have heard the phrase “informed consent,” sometimes amended as “enthusiastic consent”: That sounds great! Don’t worry, we’ll get there and clarify.

“Consent,” in an erotic context, basically means “to be willing.” The dictionary definition references permission, although that sounds a bit archaic: “May I have permission to have sex with you?” But consider the alternative—not having permission! Touching a person sexually who isn’t willing to have this experience is illegal and wrong. It amounts to sexual battery or rape.

A person who is willing to have certain sexual experiences and consents to them isn’t necessarily interested and willing to do anything and everything. In fact, there’s an old BDSM joke about this: The powerful Mistress asks her cowering but eager submissive, “What will you do for me?” “Anything!” the submissive excitedly proclaims. “Anything?” she purrs menacingly. “Anything!” the sub says again. “Well then, worm,” snaps the Mistress, “paint my house!”

OK, you might not think that’s as amusing as a Mistress would, but the central idea can’t be repeated strongly enough: We give consent for specific activities, not anything at all a partner might want to do. This idea was enshrined in what became known as The Antioch Rules in the early 1990s: Antioch is a progressive college campus where people wanting to have sex with each other were told they should get permission every step of the way. “May I kiss you? May I take off your shirt? May I touch your breasts? May I slide my hands down your belly? May I unzip your pants?” I think you see where this is going. Pundits made fun of it at the time, since nothing so specific about the language of sexual consent had ever been discussed in the mainstream. Sometimes doing something this extreme creates awareness and informs a generation or at least group of individuals who can use that experience throughout life.

So consent is a willingness to do only X—the activity or activities you consented to do! Consenting to kiss isn’t necessarily consent to have intercourse; consenting to vaginal intercourse is never consent for anal; consenting to anal intercourse is not consent for vaginal; consent with a condom does not give consent for barebacking. Consent is contingent and revocable. Contingent means it’s dependent upon something, and revocable means it can be withdrawn and vetoed: You only consent as long as you consent, and you can change your mind.

We all have boundaries, and each of us—as we have mentioned many times—has specific preferences and responses. This is part of the reason we need to think of consent in specific terms: Not everyone likes the same kind of sex, or touch, or fantasy, or anything. In the consent-conscious world of BDSM a tool has been developed to help people think and talk about their boundaries and their ability to negotiate for what they want or are willing to explore. Back to your Yes, Maybe, and No lists of all the things you want to do, might be up for depending on the circumstances, and do not want to do.

So let’s say you have your own three lists. Clearly, your No items are activities to which you are not likely to consent: You don’t want to do them, period! Your Yes items may not always elicit a Yes in real life—maybe you’d do those with a partner but not a stranger, or in certain other circumstances you might negotiate for a few, but not all, of those acts. Even they are contingent. The Maybe list is the most contingent of all, because “maybe” itself is a word that references contingency: It depends.

So for your own positive and happy sex life, it’s not enough to list some things you might want to do; ask yourself, “What specifics do each of these ‘maybes’ depend on?” If you’re turned on enough? With a trusted partner? Have plenty of time? No children in the next room to distract you? The right time of the month? Maybe you’d do it with a woman but not a man. Maybe you’d only do it if you got paid. Maybe you’d only do it if you loved the person.

Anything—literally anything—can affect our sense of willingness and sexual comfort level. A sexual experience you’d relish and desire on one day, or with one partner, might seem too much or somehow non-erotic under other circumstances. An activity you didn’t want to do at all at one point in your life might be a birthday favorite years later. Something you loved early in your relationship isn’t desirable now because it reminds you of happier days. You enjoyed a particular sex act before you had a baby but not so much anymore.

Not only is our consent contingent on various elements—our sense of desire and arousal is, or can be, too. Our ability to get aroused—at all, or by a specific person or activity—may fluctuate over time and be associated with varying conditions. You will have a far more satisfying sex life if you can recognize what these conditions are.

Now, you can consent to things you do not desire—though it might be a good idea to ask yourself why you might do so. You might be willing to have sex, or a certain kind of sex, to please someone, or to give it a whirl this one time, or for pay, or to learn more about your own responses. The notion of consent doesn’t, all by itself, require desire, but we think erotic experience with desire is the preferred model, so if you do not feel desire associated with the sex act you’re engaged in, we hope you won’t just leave it at that. The rest of this book is intended to help you find out what activities you do desire.

One more thing about consent: Its many contingencies are yours, not someone else’s. In a sex-negative culture, this is an important point. No one can say someone should or shouldn’t consent to a particular sexual activity—it’s not their business!—as long as that person can give informed consent: they’re old enough, sober enough, able to understand what’s being proposed, and all the other ways “informed consent” can be defined. If someone does not have information about, or cannot understand, the activity for which their consent is requested, it means they cannot give informed consent.

On the other hand, you can give consent to sexual activities you don’t feel particularly enthusiastic about or personally desire. As stated above, there are many reasons why a person might do this. We know plenty of people who consented to do things they didn’t ultimately enjoy, just to see whether they liked them—and that was their right. You can say “yes” or “no” for your own reasons, whatever they may be. However, don’t consent to something and then determine later that it didn’t meet your expectations, and then decide you said yes but you meant no. That’s simply lying to yourself if you keep those thoughts in your head, and to others should you say it aloud. Sometimes we say yes to things that we later wish we hadn’t, or we don’t have regrets about the “yes” but we still didn’t like it. Consent is not a guarantee you’ll have a great time, in other words, though it can definitely help.

For example, you might say yes to bungee-jumping with your graduating class because it’s your last hurrah together, and end up hating it. But you might still be glad you said yes: You were with your pals, you’re in all the pictures, and it went down in history that you were there. Sure, it gave you a heart attack—now you know you will never do it again—but you don’t regret doing it that once. An example of saying yes and regretting it might start out the same way, but the bungee jump scared you so badly that you wound up traumatized—you couldn’t care less if you never see those people again! You hated it, you hate yourself for saying yes, and you hate everyone in class for encouraging you to come along.

That happens to everyone—we say yes to stuff we regret after we experience it, from “Why did I eat that?” to “Why did I do that?”—it’s how we grow and learn to know what our boundaries are. But you don’t blame the class for forcing you into bungee-jumping—in the end, you made the decision to participate. It’s the same with sex: If you consent to sex with someone, then decide in the morning you didn’t like it, they aren’t to blame for your having participated.





We say YES!!!


The point of consent is not just to forestall nonconsensual situations: abuse, date rape, and the like. The point is—ideally—to create a situation in which a person wants to say yes, and desires the sex to which they consent. This is the basis of enthusiastic consent.

Enthusiastic consent may be an unrealistic standard sometimes or for some people, but each of us can ask ourselves: “What would it look like if all my sexual experiences were enthusiastically consented to? What might get in the way of this now? Is there a way I can move toward that ideal sex life?”

But in fact, there is always a way to move toward your ideal sex life. One step, in fact, is reading this book and gearing up with more information. We’re going to say something controversial about consent here: The very idea of “informed consent,” much less enthusiastic consent, is challenging in a culture that does not support sex information and education. From that point of view, it’s a good thing you’re here—this book aims to give you at least the basics, which may support your ability to decide whether or not to consent to a particular sexual activity. Incomplete sex education rarely if ever gives young people the skills they need to navigate a complex sexual landscape that requires sophisticated thinking about consent, contingency, and reasons to have sex. And this society does not actually want us to be sophisticated about sex, especially women, especially young women.

Yes, this topic is in certain respects gendered—though, as we have pointed out elsewhere, a person’s gender does not guarantee they will experience anything in a particular way. Young men are given the cultural message that it’s up to them to initiate, or “get,” sex; this has been true for decades, if not millennia, though not all men buy into this role. Young and not-so-young women’s messages are mixed and thus confusing today: Females are still considered gatekeepers of their own “virtue” but also often feel a (gendered) pressure to be, appear, and act sexy.

Also, and relatedly, we’ve been writing as though the entire onus for ensuring consent is on the person who does or doesn’t consent—the one who decides “yes” or “no” when someone else asks them to have sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Both (or all) parties to the proposed sexual activity are active stakeholders who can ensure it occurs in an atmosphere of consent. The person who expresses a desire for sex (of whatever kind) from another person can ask themselves whether any consent seems freely given, and whether there are any contingencies (power differentials, emotional elements, etc.) that might make a “yes” or a “no” dependent and possibly problematic. They can refrain from pressuring the other person or ever using coercion or threats of any kind. This culture tends to recognize a breach of consent if it was violent or under threat of violence, but many other kinds of threat—to reputation, to relationship—can also lead to dubious or absent consent, as can those elements that we listed when we discussed informed consent.





Slut-Shaming


How do we know we don’t live in a truly sex-positive world? There are lots of indicators, but an important one is the continued prevalence of slut-shaming. This has a sexist angle, for sure, because women are more likely to be slut-shamed, even women and girls who do not fit the common definitions of “slut”—and to make matters worse, it’s often young women who are slut-shamed, which can make the already challenging process of coming into and accepting one’s own sexuality much harder. No matter where it falls on the range from teasing to bullying and beyond, slut-shaming is a threat to women (and those who want to be close to women), and, ironically, it is often other women and girls who slut-shame—so those who do it are making their own love lives more toxic, because of the problematic attitudes about women and sexuality they have helped to promote.

Here are some points we’d like to make about slut-shaming:

No one deserves to be shamed and taken to task by others for consensual sexual choices and actions.

Any source of shame—from family, strangers, social media “friends”—can harm self-esteem and impair trust in others.

Slut-shaming even occurs when the shamed person has been the victim of a sexual attack. It is targeted to disempower and harm.

Slut-shaming is closely related to gay-baiting, trans-bashing, and other ways that people are targeted for their sexuality, gender, or other differences.

Slut-shaming and these other forms of bullying and baiting say much about the insecurities of the person who dishes it out—not that that is likely to make the recipient feel any better about it.

These forms of bullying are not to be taken lightly and are never acceptable behavior.

If you have been slut-shamed, you are not alone. This happens to many, many people and it is not OK. Please reach out for help.





Every person has the right to desire and to feel attraction to another person or people. This does not give them the right to get what they want from that person, though, if the latter does not consent.

What about non-verbal consent? Isn’t enthusiastic desire and response a clear form of consent?

Well, yes, perhaps—but only if those aforementioned contingencies do not get in the way, and only if informed consent is already part of the picture. It’s always a good idea to verbalize the non-verbal, as language skills allow. And it can be sexy! Saying “Do you want this? Tell me what you want,” is hot.

Culturally, our greatest challenge is to reinforce consent without shaming desire. In a society where women (especially) can be slut-shamed for saying Yes, we are awash in consent challenges, because it is not guaranteed that an expression of desire will be respected. That is one foundational challenge to a consent culture: Shame and opprobrium get in the way. As you already know, since you’ve read this far, we aim to help each of us claim pleasure as a birthright, and pleasure is far more readily claimed in an atmosphere of consent.





Do I Have Enough Sex? Is It Good?


Do I have enough sex?


There’s no right amount of sex to have nor any normative time frame to have it—people vary greatly as to their libido and partner availability, not to mention what counts as sex to them in the first place. This would be a good moment to mention that solo sex counts, especially as far as the health benefits of sex are concerned: “Use it, don’t lose it”; stress relief; encouraging blood flow and the pleasant brain chemicals released with arousal and orgasm. Some people don’t want sex at all. Others can’t get enough. The rest of us are somewhere on the continuum between the two, and many contingencies may be relevant: how recently our relationship with our partner began; whether there is any sexual trauma in our history; how busy we are; whether we have kids; our overall health and wellbeing.

However: If you find yourself wishing you had more sex, or yearning for a different partner situation, or feeling nostalgic for your sexual past—these could be signs that you want more sex, or the things you get from sex, like a sense of your own desirability, intimacy, touch, and so on than you’re able to arrange.

There’s no need to pressure yourself to have more sex, but it is good to assess whether there are barriers in the way. If there are, there may be ways to address them, and your overall sex life, maybe even your whole life, can benefit.





Is it good?


Good sex also can’t be defined just one way, but if it leaves you physically and emotionally satisfied, it’s probably pretty darn good. Sex can give you bodily pleasure and relaxation, connect you more deeply with your partner, and fill you with joy. If sex is emotionally touched by shame or guilt, a feeling of having been pressured, having done things you didn’t really desire, or that you weren’t appreciated during the act—those aren’t “good sex” feelings. Other “not good sex” feelings might be: sex is uncomfortable, painful, or even “meh,” you are not especially aroused, you don’t get close to orgasm or just can’t come. At best, those are signs of “sex that could have been way better.”

Physical problems can lead to discomfort, but so does penetration that happens too soon, with too little lubrication; a partner who doesn’t know how to help you become aroused; one’s own lack of connection with one’s body and its arousal and preferences (bad sex ed can set us up for this); and just going too quickly through sex to allow arousal to build to the point that it can peak in an orgasm.

The good news: There is a lot of good information out there, and in this book, about good sex, and many educators who want to help. Sex therapy makes a difference, even just couple’s counseling, if the main problem is lack of respect or healthy communication in a relationship. We deserve good sex and most of us can improve our experience if we make it a priority to do so.





I Want Do-Overs: Communicating Desires Once You’re Already Partnered


We know many of you would like this section to include a gift card for a free crystal ball or mind-reading class. Sorry!

Let’s face it: Direct and clear communication is not how most of us learned to speak about sex. Most of us were not taught how to make our erotic wishes known, or in fact encouraged to express them at all. But speaking up is by far the clearest way to get what you want, leaving less opportunity for a partner to misunderstand, or inject their preferences or biases between the lines.

We’re set up to believe we know all about sex and relationships based on whatever we read in popular magazines or romance novels, view in movies, and see in adult films. We assume everybody likes and responds to similar activities in bed, and wants the same kinds of relationships; these assumptions both create and are reinforced by our tendency to consider some things “normal” and everything else odd or perverted. When we can’t talk about our similarities and differences, we get the idea that sex is one particular kind of experience, not a great diversity of possible preferences and responses—and this attitude interferes with our ability to learn about our own desires and our partners’.

The two primary ways to communicate are verbally and non-verbally. A couple in sync with each other can actually be successful at non-verbal communication during sex—sounds, movements, positions, and other physical indications can encourage, slow down, or otherwise change sexual activity.

Although these examples of non-verbal communication work perfectly for some people, they can be misread and not work out well for others. If you and your partner don’t “read” each other correctly, the message won’t be received as sent. The fact is that if you aren’t enjoying something sexually and you try to wiggle around or out of it, two unexpected consequences could result: Your partner might think all that writhing means you’re in the throes of ecstasy, which isn’t the message you want to send. Or they could recognize what you’re trying to communicate, but focus on the negative and feel hurt. Soon you might hear a sad (or even irritable) whine of, “But I thought you liked that!” In actuality, there’s no need for blame or hurt feelings. Both of you should remember: You didn’t get sex education that prepared you to communicate about the finer points of the sex acts you love (or those you don’t). What’s important now is the two of you, your feelings for each other (attraction, love, whatever is in the mix), and your ability to learn from your experiences and build a better sex life! In addition to that insufficient sex ed, we are pre-loaded to receive (potentially) the wrong message by prevailing cultural ideas. We believe we know how men and women “are” and what people “want.” We miss the cues that we don’t have all the info about our partners because we’re not attuned to look for them. The good news is: We can leave that set of messages behind like so much radio static. It’s time to tune in to a new station!

We often hear people say they wish that “foreplay” lasted longer—meaning cunnilingus, a blow job, touching, making out, or any of the wonderful non-intercourse items on the erotic menu. Ask yourself this: How many times have you simply asked nicely to prolong any of these actions, instead of complaining about it later? A simple “I could do this forever” when making out, or, “Your hands drive me wild,” could stretch out foreplay endlessly. What many people consider foreplay does not have to be “fore,” anyway—precursors to intercourse, that is. Kissing, oral sex, handjobs and the like are enjoyable in and of themselves. They don’t need to stop in favor of something else if you are enjoying them. It isn’t mandatory for every sex act to conclude with intercourse.





Practical Help: Changing Old Habits


“My husband of fifteen years goes down on me too hard: fast and furious like his favorite movie! When I tried to wiggle around or pull back and show him what I liked he got upset. How can I change something we have been doing for so long?”



Talking Tips:

1) It’s best to talk about sex, especially at first, when you are not having sex. This can be difficult to do! We get that. But nevertheless, put it on your calendar. Choose when you’ll have a block of unimpeded time—not when you’re heading out the door to go somewhere, or with guests on the way, but when you can take a walk or a drive together, share dinner or a glass of wine, or at any other time when you’re experiencing togetherness. Sometimes, your partner might be hurt or take it personally when you express a desire for something new or different, as if you’re saying they aren’t “good in bed.” Talking about sex in a non-sexual setting can make it easier for someone to hear what you’re saying without overreacting.

2) Flattery works, whether you call it “a spoonful of sugar” or “accentuate the positive.” Say something along the lines of, “Not all couples can talk like we do. I am so happy that I can tell you anything, since we are so close and you are so fun/understanding/experimental/committed. I would really like to try _______.” Then fill in the blank with what you are hoping to change or add to your sex life.

3) Keep the focus on the present and future. If your partner asks about the past and says, “But I thought you liked XY&Z,” you don’t need to say, “No! I’ve hated it this whole time.” Instead try something like, “Mmm, maybe my body is changing.” (Thoughtfully) “I’ve read that our bodies are always changing with age/hormones/etc…” That’s true, and it places the focus on the present and the future.

4) Do communicate during sex. Another positive communication tip: Say “I love doing this,” or “I could have your hands on me forever,” or “This part of making love is my favorite,” or “Let’s just do this for a long time.” And if you need a reason, add, “…like we’re teenagers.”

Sometimes asking for what you want requires education. Let’s say you’re a woman who wants more clitoral touch, but your partner believes most women come (or should come) from intercourse alone. Statistics show that’s not correct—as we’ve already discussed in previous sections of this book, they are misinformed, as so many people are about this issue.

Depending on their personality type—some people do not take well to being corrected—you could simply show them better sources of information—a website, a book, or an educational video. Sometimes what matters most is your ability to verbalize what you want, or at least what you want to try; sometimes our partners are dying for us to give them information and eager to give us exactly what we want. If we’re too shy to do it, or we believe they should just magically “know” what we’d like, both of us are doomed to less-than-optimal sex. Sometimes we long for activities that turn out to be better as fantasies than realities, but we don’t find this out until we give them a go. That brings us to…





Communicating New Desires


What if you want something brand-new or complex that you haven’t tried? Your communication about this can be direct, or it could include the more subtle realms of hints and flirtation; it can also be done in writing via notes, fantasy stories, emails, or texts, rather than face-to-face. Shy people may want to commit their thoughts to paper or a computer screen first.

Note: The written word preserves your sexy ideas—so if you ever plan to run for the Senate, prepare to have your love notes scrutinized! And don’t engage in flirtation on a phone or computer you don’t own—such as one your company gives you to use for work. This can be grounds for dismissal in some companies. Sorry if this cramps your style! You might have to get your own technology, for privacy’s sake.

Want some homework assignments that are fun to do together? Read Exhibitionism for the Shy, even if you aren’t shy! The book has something for everyone; it is filled with ideas. Whether or not you succeed in checking each “wish” off your sexual to-do list, the journey itself is wonderful—and negotiating the various elements of your fantasies will make you a better communicator, and help you and your partner become better intimates.

Another book with great “sexercises” to do solo or with a partner is Sex for the Clueless which, despite its title, is geared towards those at every level of sexual awareness.





Polyamory and Open Relationships


“Polyamory” is a term first coined by Morning Glory Zell that means “loving many,” or at least more than one. Research indicates that most people will not be monogamous for their entire lives—that is, old-school, one-partner-until-death-do-us-part monogamous. Even when a couple is true to each other for the duration of their relationship, these days there is likely to be more than one partner in each person’s life. Even when people strive for true-blue “finding The One,” they usually practice serial monogamy, one monogamous partner after another, not “there’s one, and only one, person for me.” In the context of serial monogamy, if you have relatively brief relationships, you can rack up a lot of partners. This is one reason why safer sex is important for everybody—most people have had sex with someone who’s had sex with someone else, thereby multiplying the chances of spreading STIs.

Polyamorous and open relationship partisans don’t believe in the “one and only” notion to begin with. There are many ways to live a life having relationships with more than one partner.



Q: Am I polyamorous if I just like dating around? What’s the difference between being single and being poly?

A: Dating around could be called a form of open relationship structure—but it isn’t polyamory. If you’re poly you have more than one lover, and they are in your life on a significant basis—you think of them as an ongoing partner, and all your partners know about each other. Either way you should be up front on your first date with someone, letting him or her know that you might be/are going on dates or seeing other people, and assume the other person is doing the same unless they tell you otherwise. This is the time to evaluate whether you are dating/seeing a person who wants you to be their One and Only. If you start having deeper feelings and wanting an ongoing relationship with someone, you need to decide if you are going to “close” the relationship and not date others, or if you want to be in an ongoing relationship with this person while staying “open” by dating others. Full discussion of your feelings is vital, and honesty is required so that you both know if you are compatible in this way.





Many Choices, Poly Choices: A Guide to Open Relationship Modes


Sexy & Single. Some singles are the swingin’ type who may or may not want to settle down eventually, but in the meantime they enjoy hook-ups, playing the field, having a lover in every port, and/or enjoying erotic times with fuck-buddies, also known as “friends with benefits.” Other singles have more important things to do with their time than run around and date, unless a particularly attractive someone comes along. No one says you have to prioritize a frisky search for sex partners—it’s just that some people do.

Having An Affair. Many partnered people “cheat”—they let their partner think they’re monogamous when they aren’t. We are not recommending this—we’re just stating the facts.

When the Cat’s Away. Some people give their partner a pass to engage in sex with others when one of them is out of town, as long as it’s discreet, safe, and doesn’t rock the boat. This last rule means theirs is the primary relationship, and these dalliances are just that: dalliances. Sometimes this is combined with “don’t ask, don’t tell,” meaning they can’t come home from the trip and discuss what happened. Some people, though, love telling and hearing all the juicy details.

The More The Merrier. Some twosomes keep an eye out for a third person (or another couple) with whom to enjoy erotic play; still others go to swing parties or play parties—they have an open relationship together and do not go out solo. The difference between swing and play is mainly cultural; swingers’ parties tend to require that people attend in pairs only, one male and one female. Some let unaccompanied women in, but rarely unaccompanied men. “Play parties” might not have this rule, and can be queer or mixed-orientation, focus on kinky play like BDSM, or have other specific qualities that distinguish them from swing parties.

The Third Wheel Drives Just Fine. Some couples open their relationship to a third person with the intent of creating an ongoing three-person triadic relationship. Outside of this new person, they may or may not have an open relationship.

Classic Polyamory. One, both, or many partners in a relationship can also have other relationships—mind you, not sneaky “Dad has another family in the neighboring town” situations, but openly acknowledged lovers. Any duo in this situation may need to think about which relationship is primary for them; polyamorous people tend to value this degree of clarity and specificity, since it helps prevent confusion about relationship goals and priorities.

Silver Polyamory. Shar and Christina Sophie came up with this phrase to describe the growing number of people who think that some form of polyamory is the best way to grow old together. Seniors might enjoy the freedom of an engaging, and possibly new-to-them, “alternative” sex life. Some people derive greater emotional and personal security when they have more than one person they can rely on and love. As we age, considering health issues and even mortality, those involved in a relationship with more than one person might feel they have extra helping hands, support, and companionship, compared to living a monogamous or a single life. Also, as the generations who were more out about polyamory age into seniorhood, they may bring their loves and lifestyles with them. Let’s be clear, though—this is a good choice only for people into open relationships in the first place or who have the wherewithal to manage poly relationships. An older person can get just as jealous as a younger one if they are not into having “competition.”

The point of polyamory is to openly conduct all relationships with consent and a lack of subterfuge. One might have a primary (or original) lover that generally knows or has at least met the other partner/s, and given them their blessing. Sometimes the group of partners is so close that they could spend Thanksgiving or other holidays together. They may even live together. Such polyamorous tribes often consider themselves as close as families—because they are families, sometimes with kids and other times a “family of choice” comprised of only adults.

This doesn’t mean poly people know all about their partners’ sex lives with others, though some might be comfortable with that. The keys to successful polyamory are the ability to communicate well, control or process jealousy and possessiveness, and schedule time fairly.

And perhaps it goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: Polyamory should be a freely-chosen lifestyle for everyone involved. In order to behave consensually, a poly person must disclose that they are polyamorous right up front when they meet a new potential partner—none of this business of discovering later on that they are married, much less to more than one other person! As one of the early theorists of polyamory, Deborah Anapol, author of Love Without Limits, said, “It’s the mixed marriages that get into trouble,” meaning those relationships in which one or more of the partner/s really wants a monogamous connection, but puts up with a polyamorous partner just to hold onto them. This is fair to neither partner. Mixed marriage can also go the other way—one partner is poly at heart, but tries monogamy because they love and want to partner with someone who insists on it. We don’t mean folks have to be married, either—figure of speech.





What it Takes to Be Successfully Polyamorous


The elements that make polyamory work can help with many other kinds of relationships, and not just ones with lovers—maybe even including successful monogamy!

Polyamory is chosen or accepted, as we’ve said, and enthusiastically chosen is even better. To function successfully, these relationships require strong interpersonal skills and types of communication that aren’t much fun if you don’t want to be having the conversation in the first place. Of course, we could also say that about monogamous pairings, couldn’t we? When both partners have a mindset of, “We can make this work, let’s just keep talking and thinking until we do,” often it does work! This attitude is one of the most important elements of successful polyamory.

Sexually secure personality or self-esteem. If you are someone who is confident about yourself, your sexual abilities and your feelings, then you are less likely to put your ego under your partner/s’ control. We are not saying that you shouldn’t receive compliments and ego-stroking: We expect thoughtful partners to give out genuine compliments as they come to mind, which is not only loving but helps us feel connected and confident.

Excellent time management skills. Hanging out with one or the other of your poly partners will not likely occur magically—it requires scheduling. In a monogamous relationship, especially one in which the partners live together, couple time may not have to be as mindfully arranged: You get home from work, and there’s your partner. Of course, some monogamous couples share busy lives that could use a little more scheduling, especially of romantic time together. Poly folks require good calendars and need to keep them in sync, plus the sensitivity to understand the varying needs of each partner. And people who are sharing an over-booked partner need to be able to speak up about their own needs for quality time.

Luckily these skills can be learned! Time management is way easier than some other skills that are necessary for an ideal relationship.

Communication. Some poly folks engage in a profoundly deep level of communication that can happen with more than one partner, for the sake of which they happily deal with the complicated necessity of balancing everyone’s time, desires, needs, and agendas. A high degree of openness can be exciting and satisfying in and of itself, and for some people this might be one attraction of the poly lifestyle. It probably helps to be enthusiastically into communication, connection, and intimacy to begin with. But some people just aren’t into the degree of processing that goes along with being polyamorous. The latter type negotiates their time and intimacy needs up front and doesn’t want to spend a lot of time refining and sharing thereafter. If something that requires processing comes up, though, they are well-served to address it openly and comfortably, and not resent the time it takes to resolve. Again, does anyone hear a vague echo of monogamous relationships’ communication styles here?

Jealousy management skills. Jealousy can be the elephant in the room in a polyamorous relationship circle, but, as many dyed-in-the-wool monogamous people know, pledging you’ll be true to one another—and staying true to that promise—doesn’t always banish the green-eyed monster with a snap of the fingers.

Some basics: Comparing your partners to one another in a way that makes anyone feel one-down is a no-go strategy; that’s just asking for trouble, and at the risk of sounding judgmental, if you do that, you deserve it. For a potentially jealous partner, a high level of personal comfort and an ability to communicate needs and wants can help; conscientious attentiveness from partner/s regarding jealousy can ward off a crisis—but it’s a fine balancing act, since worrying 24/7 can be a drain on a relationship. And having partners who listen is crucial—oftentimes we don’t necessarily want our partner to do anything; we just want to be heard and have our feelings acknowledged. Being heard can dispel the panic that can set in when jealousy rears its head, since at the heart of jealousy lies fear of being ignored and, worse, being abandoned.

Enjoy compersion. Come-what? A relationship theory called “compersion” is cited by many polyamorous people as being hugely important to them in their ability to process jealousy. Basically, it means “the pleasure I get in my partner’s pleasure.” Not absolutely required, but it helps: When you can truly appreciate that your partner values what they get from another person—and get that you, too, might experience joy with someone else, whether or not you have another partner—it shifts your sense of where each partner’s experiences of value may come from, sometimes away from that “one and only” model.

Maintain one’s own “to-do” list. People with unfinished projects, family responsibilities, the urge to climb a mountain or bungee-jump, a thesis to finish, what-have-you—those who are content to amuse themselves alone or without their lovers can often step more easily into the poly lifestyle than those without separate interests or activities. Loving solitude or dreading it might be one measure to help determine whether someone’s cut out for a poly life. It’s never a plus to have the majority of one’s self-esteem be reliant on a partner and how they treat you.

Please note, too, that in a polyamorous relationship, even one in which both/all partners enthusiastically want to structure their relational lives this way, chemistry is still important, and it’s possible that not every new partner might fit in with the larger group. Poly families are not all like Fundamentalist Mormon sister-wives sharing a husband (though you could argue that those families are a variant of polyamorous), but the reason those families get a reality TV show is partly because of the inherent drama in how a new wife gets along with the already established ones. In a polyamorous family, there are more relationships than one to be developed, even if not all of them are sexual. Every time someone new gets involved with one of the partners, relationships increase not just numerically but geometrically.

Why do people favor this love style? Some seem to be naturally cut out for it; others not so much. Those who fare well with polyamory are able to share their attentions fairly with more than one person, have good self-esteem, and value the ways in which having more than one partner allows them to explore different parts of themselves, experience varying sexual connections—including enjoying perhaps a kind of sex with one partner that another partner just isn’t interested in—and maximize the amount of love they can give and receive.





Should You Try Polyamory?


We’re not going to answer that question; instead, we’ll ask you a few of our own to help you figure it out yourself.

How are your relationship skills?

How about communication?

What elements of relationship do you most want and value?

Do you want to be polyamorous because you do not want to “settle down”? If so, then you are doing what used to be called “playing the field.” Nothing wrong with that, as long as your behavior is honest and safe. But polyamory can be like “settling down times two” or more, so decide what level of open relationship is right for you before you identify as poly.

Are you in a relationship, or many, and don’t like getting too intimate, so you conveniently find someone new to obsess over until the next new obsession comes along? To this person we say: You might want to learn how to resolve long-term problems, investigate deeper intimacy, and be open-minded about what happens after the honeymoon phase of a relationship—just suggestions for the near or far future. On the other hand, you might be happier as a swinging single.

Do you feel pressured? Do you feel like you need to be poly or a part of the “swing set” in order to be “cool,” in, or “now”? If so, there are plenty of fish in the sea, so to speak, and you would be better served to find a perfectly great monogamous person who will like you as you are, without demanding that you accept a lifestyle you don’t really want. Putting it a different way: A poly partner who doesn’t want to be poly, up front or deep down, is not an appropriate partner for someone who wants to be poly!

Some people explore open relationships looking for The One. Others don’t believe in the concept of The One to begin with. How about you? In a community of people whose values include openness or polyamory, don’t look for a partner you don’t want to share with others.

Are you comfortable with solo time and hanging out by yourself? A happy poly person is often the one who’s glad to have some solitude when their partner goes off for some quality time with another.



These questions may help serve as a test of whether or not you want to try polyamory. Poly love is not the kind of thing you casually try on to see if it fits, since it involves intertwined relationships with several people, from which it can be difficult or painful to extricate yourself. Be honest with yourself about your relationship wants and needs—it’s a great precursor to the honesty you will ideally bring to any relationship, whether it’s with your One and Only or a puppy-pile of polyamorous loves.





Pregnancy


“I heard that the second trimester turns women into non-stop nymphos, but how can that be when I can’t stop vomiting?!”

“I have discharges oozing out of me that I didn’t even know existed.”

“My sense of smell is heightened. Is that why my pussy smells like baking cookies?”

“I’ve rubbed my boyfriend’s penis raw, literally raw, because I am so horny all the time. He actually drew the limit at once a day!”

“People said you could get hemorrhoids, and I thought they meant normal, small hemorrhoids. I had no idea this would be hanging out down there.”

As these comments by women make crystal clear, pregnancy can affect sexuality in many ways. From hormones to hygiene, during pregnancy your once-familiar body can feel like a science experiment with something new and unexpected happening every day.

These changes can enhance and inhibit your sex life. The women who seem to be the least stressed when it comes to dealing with these changes are those who recognize that almost all of it is normal, and thus approach whatever’s going on with a lively curiosity and a positive attitude. It’s as if they’re on an adventure and going along for the ride. What will be sliding out of my vagina today? How big will my vulva lips swell? How many bras am I going to have to buy, beg, borrow or steal, since my chest and breast size goes up and down daily?

Pregnancy is not a medical crisis as it’s sometimes perceived to be, but a perfectly normal physiological process. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that anyone in our sanitized culture is going to mention all the sexy and/or bloody details before they start happening to you.

We’ll address pregnancy primarily through the lens of someone who intends to give birth. We’re aware that many women find themselves unexpectedly pregnant, or they may not intend to, or be able to, bring their pregnancy to term. Some of this information will still be relevant, though the emotional context may feel totally different; we urge anyone who is not intentionally or happily pregnant to get all the help they need to support them in their situation.





Bodily Concerns or “Is it Hormonal?”


While some mothers-to-be find that pregnancy gets them feeling randy, it’s also possible to not feel sexy at all. Some women connect their low libido to the way their body appears in the mirror—the changes of pregnancy are at odds with their sexual self-image. Others feel the kind of self-consciousness that closely replicates PMS, and is therefore hormonally driven. As long as you physically feel up to sex, this is one of those times you might just want to trust your partner’s opinion that indeed you do look amazing and beautiful.

Many people love nipple stimulation and/or the sensation of their breasts being held, stroked, or even grabbed. Pregnancy can dramatically alter breast sensitivity, though, and in fact this change can occur early in pregnancy, possibly well before you show, or even before you know you’re pregnant. For those who didn’t already have especially sensitive breasts, and for women whose breast size is smaller than they would have wanted if they’d won the Breast Size Lottery, these changes might heighten their sense of attractiveness, sexiness, and erotic sensitivity. Your partner might like you with larger breasts, too, so couples often have fun with this erotic bonus of pregnancy.

On the other hand, women who already had more than a handful of boobage, or are extra sensitive, might suddenly find their new and enhanced version uncomfortable or even painful. Some women don’t want their breasts touched at all during different times during pregnancy. Your partner can’t read your mind about this preference, so speak up!

Some women who love anal intercourse might want to continue it during pregnancy—remember, though, that this is a time when care must be taken in going from anus to vagina, or engaging in any other sexual practice that might put E. coli or other harmful bacteria in or near the vagina. Pregnancy is not the time to get either an STI or a garden-variety infection! The microbe that makes you itch or have a discharge when you’re not pregnant might be bad news for the baby when you are.

Even if anal play is not a part of your sex life during this or any other time, remember that a “pro-anal play” high-fiber diet full of fruits, vegetables and wholesome grains helps your health and comfort all the way around—especially later in pregnancy when constipation can make even vaginal intercourse uncomfortable. Note, too, that sometimes hemorrhoids get worse, or show up for the first time, during pregnancy or childbirth; a high-fiber diet is recommended here as well. And contrary to some people’s assumptions, anal intercourse is not necessarily bad for you if you have hemorrhoids, nor does it cause them. If anything, it may alleviate them—not a reason to engage in it, but a bonus if you do.

One “side effect” of pregnancy that many people know nothing about is the possibility of a heightened sense of smell and/or taste. Scents or tastes you always liked, or thought nothing of, or only found vaguely unpleasant may now overwhelm you. You might smell your own body acutely and worry that everyone else smells you, too. Remember, you now have sensory superpowers, so that’s not likely if you’re maintaining decent hygiene. Going down on your partner, whether male or female, can be a smell-o-rama, and maybe not in a good way. You might find yourself overpowered by scents that you never even noticed in the past, or that you once loved. It’s because of the same bionic nose that makes some pregnant women nauseous when they smell certain foods; it can also feel like too much sensory input to smell a person’s body odor.

If you both used to love oral sex, we encourage you to talk openly about this heightened scent issue. Ignoring it doesn’t help, and avoiding the topic might hurt a partner’s feelings, since they won’t know it’s a side effect of the physiological changes of pregnancy. Add it to your pregnancy joke book, or try to solve the problem via hygiene: You might have to say, “Honey, no offense, but I need you super-scrubbed if you want me anywhere near you.” And make sure you like the scent of the soap they use, so when they come back squeaky clean, balls and all, you’ll actually want to follow through!

Your own scent may change with pregnancy, which can affect sex on the receiving, not just the giving, end. We mentioned that the vulva and vagina may have stronger or different smells than before; some women worry about receiving oral sex because of this. Let your partner make that decision. If they are hot, happy, horny and ready to go, for heaven’s sake don’t stop them, unless your physical sensitivity dictates that you don’t want that much stimulation in the first place! Feel free to let yourself relax and enjoy it. You deserve it. See our oral sex chapter for more details about going down.





Sex Drive and Comfort Levels


As we said, your libido may go off the charts—or not. This is one of the variables of pregnancy; while your hormones are definitely taking you on a joyride, they may or may not make you feel all sexed up. To further complicate matters, this may change over the course of nine months, and again after you give birth. Body image plays a significant role: Do you think you’re sexy like this? But your body’s changing physical sensitivities matter, too. Don’t be too concerned about what is normal as far as libido is concerned, since “normalcy” is variable, but don’t hesitate to talk to your doctor and any of your partners about it. We’ll remind you again: Doctors are not always well-versed in issues of sexuality—it depends on the doc and their specialty and training—but communicating about sexuality is likely to help you deal with the changes. It can also help normalize sex talk and variation for your doctor—but if it freaks them out, it might indicate the need to change physicians!

It’s important that you don’t assume your partner will be able to sense what you need, intimacy-wise. Even if your partner is someone who’s been pregnant or been partnered with a pregnant person before, your experiences might not be the same. Speak up! If you don’t generally do that—and you know by now that we think your sex life will always be better if you do—start now. When will you ever have a better excuse than a rapidly-changing body whose responses can feel out of control?





Now’s the Time to Deal with Your Sex Life


If you are someone who has worried, questioned or otherwise been concerned about your sex life, your feelings about sex, or your sexual responses before pregnancy, then please read and re-read this book from front to back to jump-start your healing. Your worries or physical issues won’t improve after you give birth, at least not soon, since you’re about to take on the intensive job of nurturing a tiny new human from helplessness to eventual independence. Many couples have significant sexual issues after a baby is born—sleep deprivation alone can wreak havoc—but these troubles were often brewing already. Don’t be passive and let this happen in your relationship. You’ve got a few months to tackle the problems and get connected. Pregnancy is a perfect time to ensure that Mommy is happy with her sex life, orgasms and feelings.

Pregnancy can be one of the most dynamic times of life for women; some come into their power in a significant way, not just from looking forward to motherhood, but because they are able to step up and fully inhabit a central role in their lives. Make sure your sexual happiness and comfort stays on the agenda if those pregnancy hormones help you connect to your inner Superwoman.

That said, pregnancy is hard work: Your body is hosting a whole new human, and your entire system is participating in this project. Your hormonal levels have changed radically. You’re carrying around a few extra pounds—or a lot of extra! With all this, it’s no surprise that exhaustion might set in from time to time, or for a significant segment of your pregnancy. This will affect your ability to perform the responsibilities of life—and its pleasures, like sex. It’s not only pregnant people who deal with this—if you were working 90-hour weeks launching a new software system, you might feel just as tired. But with pregnancy comes other factors that affect your body and your health; when your legs are swollen and you need to lie down, lie down! If you used to be a late-night lover, consider whether you can make a shift. It might not be a good idea to wait until late at night; you may be snoring by then. Morning sex, nooners, and afternoon delights might give you continued access to your erotic self, even if you’re asleep every night by 8:00 P.M.

Shar has advised many couples waiting for a child (whether pregnant or in the process of adoption) to have as much sex as they can before the baby comes, telling them it’s “money in the bank” for their relationship. Once the child arrives people are exhausted, often bad communicators and even overly sensitive—or the opposite, seemingly apathetic—to partner needs, since the new member of the household needs so much attention. Having had plenty of intimacy and joyful orgasms in recent weeks can keep connections alive.

Comfort with masturbating can make a difference too, during pregnancy and the postpartum months when/if energy reserves are low and/or libidos seem mismatched. Even if you don’t feel like intercourse, remember that sensuality is part of sexuality. If you and your partner want physical connection, take time for snuggling and foot rubs, back rubs and arm rubs—yes, the forearms lead to our hands and hold a lot of muscular tension—maybe from those smartphones we’re always clutching!—so this helps blood flow and relaxation.





Solo Sex and Pregnancy




Women who masturbate will probably still do so when pregnant, possibly more than ever—unless their hormones are sending out a “don’t touch me there” message. Women who didn’t indulge in self-pleasuring before pregnancy may start doing it now, and find themselves shopping online for sex toys (next-day delivery!) or rummaging through drawers for that old bachelorette gift they never took out of the box. Some women masturbate multiple times a day! It’s perfectly fine to come while you’re pregnant, unless your doctor has specifically told you to avoid orgasm. In some rare, problem pregnancies a strong climax can induce early labor, but this is not that common.

Many women are pregnant and do not have a regular sex partner. Masturbation is also a fabulous way to deal with a situation in which partners’ libidos don’t match up, or when a partner is not physically present. (In the latter situation, don’t forget those sweet and sexy technologies like computer chat and phone sex, “the next best thing to being there.”) If your partner is deployed in the military, works away from home, or is exhausted from caring for other children, masturbation is an especially useful way to make sure that all the mommies and/or daddies in the house are as happy and stress-free as possible. Masturbation is not cheating—it’s self-care and self-comfort.

One final element that may affect your, or possibly your partner’s, experience of sex during pregnancy is whether you feel it’s moral, or even simply OK, to be sexy while with child. Has pregnancy turned you into a kind of pure Madonna in your community’s eyes, your partner’s, or even your own? Some people feel unequivocally that “I am not sexy” or “My wife shouldn’t be sexy” when pregnant. If you find yourself more ashamed about sexual feelings than usual, or if your partner is avoiding intimacy, this could be the root cause, maybe even without anyone’s conscious awareness. You could thank (or blame) your upbringing for this—they might not be your feelings, but conflicted ideas you received growing up. On the other hand, some people who never imagined they would feel this way discover they have issues about whether it’s OK to be pregnant and interested in sex—it wasn’t a theory or a moral position they believed before pregnancy, yet it suddenly overwhelms them once they are pregnant. It’s not always a religious or cultural issue, either; sometimes it may derive from the shock of a heightened libido—you’d gotten comfortable with the libido level you had, not this ravenous sex-starved monster that’s taken over!—while other times it derives from worrying about whether having sex, or too much sex, or certain kinds of sex, will hurt the passenger—your baby.

The usual answer to the fear that sex is somehow dangerous during pregnancy is that sex is a natural process that, under normal conditions, won’t hurt the fetus. The baby is well-protected inside the womb. Most people have, however, heard contradictory advice: that intercourse is safe but masturbation is not, or masturbation is safe but intercourse is not. Again, under normal circumstances, both are fine. There might be exceptions to that blanket reassurance, however, depending on the type of sex you mean or how your body is handling the pregnancy. Following are a few guidelines for health and well-being.





Infertility, Insemination Alternatives & Sexual Sadness


There are a few situations in life that can lead us to feel sad when being sexual instead of feeling aroused or happy. Infertility can be one of those. The sadness isn’t necessarily just about the mechanics of reproduction, so even if you are in an LGBTQQ relationship or trying to get pregnant in a not-so-traditional way, or want to help someone who is, keep reading.

First let’s think of a couple who is having intercourse without using birth control, either to get pregnant on purpose or simply not worrying if they do get pregnant; they make love and, let’s presume, they enjoy it. Many couples love this time: Let’s jump in the sack and make babies! It can be so much fun—at first. As time goes by and no pregnancy occurs, however, sex can become associated only with trying to get pregnant. The next step for most couples is to double down, focusing on sex as a means of procreation, including how they have sex, what positions they have sex in, and what they do afterwards. They closely monitor the fertility clock: looking at cervical mucus, taking temperatures, tracking on the latest app—rather than fantasizing about enjoyable lovemaking or engaging in sex simply out of desire. Even the time spent on reading and research can take away hours that might otherwise have been spent in a more relaxing or enjoyable way. The couple may get stressed out. The next step is seeing doctors, and the fertility tests start. From there the couple could choose to stop trying to get pregnant and adopt instead, or agree to have no children, or they could spend years, and possibly a significant amount of money, on fertility treatments. Based on their income, attitudes, or lifestyle they will make choices about how far they go in the process of assisting conception and pregnancy. It’s easy to see how this might tax a relationship. All this can affect sex in the ways that any source of stress can.

But this stress is very specific to sex. Instead of being a refuge from the stress-filled world outside the couple, sex, and its expected or desired outcome, is the stressor. It’s easy to see how lovemaking might take a turn, going from something the partners shared, enjoyed, and felt central to their lives together, to become, at best, a procreative chore. Sex can become, well, not sexy. At worst, these two might blame each other, become tense and angry, or lose sleep. Some people say they don’t “feel whole” if they can’t reproduce. Or they feel they are letting down their families.

Another source of stress and sadness is the feeling that your body is betraying you if you don’t get pregnant—even if you’re a lesbian trying insemination once a month—and that your body isn’t doing what it’s supposed to do. When your lover approaches and wants to touch your body, simply looking down over your belly can bring on tears and sadness. From breasts to vagina—also known as the birth canal—your body can make you think not of sex or sensuality, with welcome feelings of arousal washing over you, but instead that your body is letting you—and perhaps your partner—down. These feelings are not necessarily tied to being heterosexual or even being in a couple. And depending on the source of the infertility, if you are the partner of someone who longs to get pregnant, you may feel your body is letting both of you down as well.

There’s no quick fix or secret trick to dealing with these emotions. If you are early in the process of trying to get pregnant we can advise you to try to keep sex sexy and focus on the way it facilitates connection. As tempting as it is to make sex mechanical and fit into a schedule, we suggest you fight that urge and take your time. If you are early into the stage of timing your sex just right, let it be an opportunity to share some laughs. That’s really all you can do, while creating some good stories about everything you did to rip your clothes off and get your hips in motion at the precise moment of greatest fertility (as if we can accurately pinpoint this!).

If you are further along in the process, we suggest that you forgive yourself and your body for any way you might think it’s not cooperating. If you are part of a couple, comforting each other, crying in each other’s arms and letting that turn to sexual comfort, if that’s natural for you, will keep you closer to each other instead of stressed and full of blame. Try to separate sex and procreation. Now that sounds weird to some people! But if you choose to take a medical and scientific route to becoming parents, one mindset that has helped some people is to think of “getting pregnant” as something you are getting professional help to achieve, just like you might pay for professional guidance in some other part of your life. And let sex go back to being sex.

If you are LGBTQQ, single, or otherwise using fertility treatments to attempt pregnancy and you are feeling sad about your body not responding as fast as you would like—or at all—then we have some suggestions for you as well. First, let your friends and family comfort you. It can be frustrating to get a lot of advice from others, but there is nothing wrong with saying, “I don’t need advice, I need comfort.” Accepting that you can’t control this situation, but can only try, is a big step. The feeling that your body isn’t doing something that is so socially pervasive and expected as pregnancy can be upsetting. People whose bodies don’t fit society’s norms—for any of a variety of reasons—know this feeling well. You are not alone. Good sex is embodied sex, and healing your connection to your body is crucial. Masturbate while giving yourself compliments and thinking healing, loving thoughts. It sounds quirky but you can talk to your body; you can say, “I know you are trying hard to do this and I love you for that. Thank you.” You can say, “I know it’s not your fault, I forgive you.” Or whatever message helps heal any tendency you’ve had to blame or beat yourself up. And we always suggest ending those self-talks with, “and you awesome Body, you deserve some pleasure. Here, let me take care of you,” while you orgasm, take a relaxing bath, do something that gives you a good belly laugh, go get a massage, or watch a sexy movie.

Research has shown that infertility itself can cause sexual problems in women, and the only way to address sexual problems is by finding the way back to sex as an erotic pleasure and, for couples, a source of stress-free togetherness. If sex has never been that for you, it can be, and you need to find your way there in the first place so sex can be a way to help you overcome sadness—not a source of it.





Positions


The best way to know if a sexual position is okay during pregnancy is if it is comfortable. Some doctors advise against full pressure on the belly and the fetus during sex, but who would find that comfortable in the first place? Experiment with positions that feel good. As your body changes, these positions will likely change as well.



If you like facing down during sex, pile up lots of pillows to lie on and situate them around your belly and breasts until it feels great to you. This might be a time when positioning pillows or sex furniture are a big plus. Spooning side by side may be most comfortable later in pregnancy—even if that’s not one of your usual go-to positions, give it a try. Ditto scissoring. Getting on top might feel better than being on the bottom; sitting on your partner’s lap will likely work well; when your belly gets too big to lean in and embrace your partner, lean back on your hands or utilize your pillow nest. Just pay attention to how comfortable any given position feels, and communicate about it with your partner.





Bottom-line sexual health issues


You should and most likely will be tested for sexually transmitted infections early in pregnancy. The only time it is safe to have unprotected sex during pregnancy is when you are in a monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested for STIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections) and given a clean bill of health by the doctor. Sometimes people take chances with their own health regarding whether or not to use a condom, but when pregnant, the risk extends to the health of the baby—and there are definite risks. HIV, herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C can all be passed on to the baby. Some of these infections can cause serious complications in the child after birth, while gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, hepatitis B and C, and genital warts (caused by HPV, the human papillomavirus) can cause complications in a pregnancy. Warts, for instance, can grow much larger during pregnancy and may even impede the birth canal enough to require a Cesarean section delivery. Most STIs can be treated even when you’re pregnant. Unless you’re sure that you had an STI before getting involved with your current partner/s and you are also certain they are free of any diseases you have, partners should always be treated also—many sexually transmitted infections can ping-pong from one partner to another and back again.

Don’t receive unprotected oral sex from anyone with an active herpes outbreak. A herpes outbreak on the mouth can be passed to the vulva. Herpes, in particular, can be passed to a baby during vaginal birth, and can affect the eyes and even, sometimes, the brain—this latter situation can be severe.

Although small amounts of blood spotting during pregnancy could be normal, you should always see your doctor right away to be sure.

Do not douche during pregnancy for any reason. Some women douche in connection with sexual activity, although it isn’t necessary; we recommend against it for those who aren’t pregnant as well. Driving water into the vagina while pregnant shouldn’t be done in any context whatsoever, including getting too cuddly with hot tub jets. Matter of fact, if you masturbate with tub jets or the bathtub faucet, we happily suggest you buy a vibrator immediately so that you can vibrate away and not get tempted by your showerhead for these nine months! It may not be a great idea to go into hot tubs or swimming pools at all when pregnant, as the easiest way to deal with infections is to avoid them.

Vaginal insertion isn’t usually a problem: intercourse, dildo play, fingers—lots of fingers, even—are all fine as long as they’re comfortable. Susie Bright wrote about fisting while pregnant—she found it was not too different from the massage techniques some birth coaches taught! Massaging the perineum with olive or coconut oil, leading up to slow and gentle hand or multiple-finger penetration can help prevent tearing and stitches during childbirth. Some midwives use the technique of emollient oil massage on the perineum during labor as well.

Using a vibrator is generally fine as well. One sex toy caution: Particularly if you’re using a hard and inflexible toy for insertion, like a hard plastic vibe or a glass or metal dildo, avoid hard, deep thrusting. Toys like this have no “give” at all. Finally, sex toy hygiene, always important, is even more important now. Use condoms on your toys if you have any doubt about whether they can be washed thoroughly.

Having said all these reassuring things to help you stay sexy and sexual while pregnant, it’s important to note that there are problem pregnancies that require precautions ranging from extended bed rest to avoiding orgasm lest its contractions bring on early labor. If your physician tells you not to have sex while pregnant, ask why, and specifically whether to avoid vaginal insertion, orgasm, or what. If this is just the advice they give all pregnant women and they don’t have a specific reason, seek out a second opinion: Get advice from an ob/gyn who doesn’t have one of those Madonna complexes we mentioned earlier!





Post-Partum Sex


Every few weeks at Good Vibrations we host Mommies’ Playdates—a reception and tour for groups of moms, especially new mothers, who deserve a little time off and some sex-positive pampering. We answer questions and listen to their stories and concerns; here are their insights and issues about getting “back in the saddle again.”





Physical healing


Many young parents have “six weeks” emblazoned in their minds— “In six weeks it’ll all be back to normal!” We wouldn’t take that bet to Vegas, though! After childbirth, healing time, especially getting-back-to-sex time, is connected to how the birth actually went—was it an easy or difficult vaginal birth, with or without tearing or an episiotomy, with a long or a short labor? Was it a C-section? Was the baby small, or a little hulk? Or twins? Or more? A significant variable can be what kind of shape the birthing parent was in to begin with, both as far as exercise vs. sedentary living is concerned as well as their overall health. It’s also a question of continuing hormonal fluctuations; more about that below.

One kind of exercise that makes a difference when getting back in shape after vaginal childbirth is Kegels. Even if the birth was by Cesarean section, it’s a good idea to continue pubococcygeus exercises—you did them to prepare for childbirth during pregnancy, right?—because even a pregnancy culminating in a non-vaginal birth can put a lot of pressure on the pelvic floor; you’ve been carrying extra weight around right atop that sling of muscles, and remember that those are the muscles responsible for vaginal tightness and part of the sensations of orgasm, among many other functions.

There’s a hormone secreted late in pregnancy called relaxin that acts to loosen not just tight muscles but also joints and ligaments so that the pelvis can expand enough to get the baby’s head through the pelvic girdle. This is great for vaginal birth—but it can make new moms a little wobbly, and this is just one element of the body’s many changes that needs to resolve after childbirth.

As with choosing positions that are comfortable with a growing belly, postpartum sex positions need to be adopted with comfort in mind. If a C-section has been the baby’s mode of entering the world, the birth parent is essentially recovering from abdominal surgery—no pressure on the belly until it’s fully healed, please! A post-C-section birth parent may be ready for rear-entry intercourse sooner than the missionary position.

Hormone production that has gone into overdrive to prepare the body for birth now shifts again, so the endocrine rollercoaster doesn’t end yet, especially if breast-feeding is on the agenda. Happy hormones are definitely in the mix here—oxytocin and other compounds that promote bonding and closeness can make the weeks and months after childbirth a time of connection with both the baby and one’s partner. Oxytocin plays an important role in the production and releasing of breast milk—if your nipples were sensitive during pregnancy, you may have a whole new experience now if you breast-feed. Some people find this sensation to be extremely sensual and voluptuous. This can strike fear into the hearts of some new moms, but it is a common feeling and not a signal that you are somehow eroticizing your child.

Speaking of eroticism and breast-feeding: Some partners find breast milk to be exciting, one more intimate element to share.

Breast-feeding will change the timeframe at which fertility returns. Generally, when menstrual periods resume, so does fertility, but just as it was during puberty and the onset of menses, ovulation can happen before the first period starts. Many new parents will need to consider contraception after childbirth. Having safe sex may also help a new mom get back in the mood, since most new parents will want planned focused time with their newborn before getting pregnant again.

Some women continue to notice vaginal dryness and issues with libido; both of which can be exacerbated by breast-feeding because of the continued hormonal changes it causes. We definitely do not want to discourage breast-feeding. But partners might want to add even more erotic touch and sensuality to sex, extending the timespan before intercourse begins—and of course making sure there’s lubricant on hand. Dry insertive sex is rarely a pleasant experience for a woman—if she’s postpartum, we’ll double down on that statement.

Masturbation can help both partners cope. In the first place, a partner who wants to be sexual can take matters into their own hands, or partners can enjoy sexy time together during which masturbation rather than intercourse is the focus. A new mom can explore how her erotic sensations have changed via masturbation, and enjoy the pleasure and relaxation that solo sex brings. Now more than ever, being comfortable with self-pleasuring is important, because even couples who don’t usually engage in much of this fine pastime may find it a very useful bridge until intercourse resumes.

Mommy’s Playdate moms often make a beeline, not to the section of the store where toys commonly enjoyed by women are displayed, but to pick out toys for male partners! Penis sleeves are great for gourmet handjobs; whether the fellas are going to get that deluxe stimulation courtesy of their partner or are going to be invited into the bedroom to take care of business while Mommy breastfeeds on the living room couch, the mothers are glad to gear up for the sake of their partner’s sexual pleasure. The exceptions are those who basically say, “That dang penis got me into all this in the first place! He can just wait til I’m good and ready!” Irreverence can let off steam sometimes, that’s for sure, as long as it’s not mean-spirited and judgmental.





Sleep deprivation and stress


The physical stress of childbirth is borne by the partner who bears the child, of course, but many of the intense changes that face new parents are shared. Both parents, if there are two in the house, may experience the sleep deprivation that affects anyone who’s home with a new baby; both parents have new roles and responsibilities, concern as well as joy. These changes themselves can get in the way of rekindling the old spark, so make sure you’re in the boat together! Get child care when you can to allow adult, intimate time; pay attention to the baby’s sleep cycles so you not only maximize time for your own much-needed rest, but for love. Avoid resentment—those ladies who won’t buy Dad a penis sleeve may be poor role models!—and practice caring communication with each other as well as self-care. Accepting other care and help (and soliciting it, if necessary) may make a big difference in helping you manage stress and become more available for grown-up pleasures.

Post-partum depression is a particularly intense form of stress, and both parents, and any familial support system, plus relevant doctors, should be involved if it is suspected.

We cannot stress enough that if you are feeling sad after giving birth or don’t feel connected to your child, it’s very important you see a doctor and tell them you might have postpartum depression. Friends or family might be telling you, “This is normal/happens to everyone/it’s just the baby blues,” and new mothers can experience this issue in varying levels of severity. Do not suffer in silence or without support.



Some new parents feel guilty having sex with a baby in the house—especially if that baby sleeps in the same room at first. This is not so different from worrying that a pregnant woman shouldn’t have sex because, you know, just because… It is fine to be a sexual adult and a parent; if it were not OK, our species would be long gone. Just make sure the baby is in a safe position before you get busy, and keep an ear out for cries of distress. If you find you just can’t relax, two words: child care.

Desire discrepancy is an issue for many couples regardless of their status as parents; many a duo has brought this concern to sex therapists over the years, and there are absolutely ways to deal with it.

Particularly if you’ve never been on separate pages before in terms of sexual desire, remember not to overthink it if you do find this happening after the birth of a child. It’s likely not your “new normal”; it’s a temporary situation caused by all the changes discussed—hormones, postpartum physical recovery, stress and sleep deprivation—not to mention the new reality of responsibility for another human being. Parents who overcome this state the quickest are those who give each other support, love, and continued sensual connection.

Pressuring a partner about sex is not a good way to move past this state, though. If the majority of women not only want sex, but want sex with someone who is good to them, becoming a clock-watcher or a nag—or worse, a sexual bully—will certainly not help matters. The most significant levels of distress we see at Playdates are among those women who have partners who don’t accept that it takes the postpartum body some time to be ready to resume intercourse. The parental roles here may be new, but sex roles play into this dilemma too.

We are not trying to minimize the non-birthing parent’s desire and need for erotic connection, by any means. We’ve also talked to new dads who have been told in no uncertain terms that the reason their partner had sex with them in the first place was to get pregnant; now being a mother is a priority for them, not being a sex partner. But this isn’t most couples’ situation, and it’s not the norm. This is a situation in which each partner’s reason for being in the relationship was either not discussed in the first place, or each person’s full expectations weren’t expressed. We go on and on about communication: this is why it’s important!

At the end of the day, for new parents and child-free partners, it’s important to remember that sex is more than just intercourse, and sexual connection—with or without intercourse—isn’t just about pleasure and getting off—lovely as these are to experience. The role of intimacy, especially between people who’ve had a child together, is vital for sex partners when it comes to ensuring erotic compatibility on a long-term basis. Loving, sensual and erotic touch can go a long way to bridge the gap between the young lovers you were who fucked like bunnies and the bonded partners you’re becoming.





It Starts With You: Sex Smart Parenting for Happier & Healthier Children


As a parent you always have your children’s best interests in mind. Thinking about them can change everything in your life, from where you work to whether or not you ride a motorcycle. Because of the irregular curriculum of sex ed in school, much of their education on being a healthy and conscientious sexual being is going to come from you. It’s not quite as daunting as it seems. Just as you’ve learned safety tips from your pre-school teacher like “Boil water on the back burner of the stove with the handle turned inwards,” you can learn tips from us like “Leave the book It’s Perfectly Normal at eye level in your child’s bedroom.” We’ve got your back, and we know the efforts you make to inform yourself and impart correct and shame-free information about sex to your kids will pay off for your peace of mind and for their health and happiness.





Talking about sex and bodies as your children grow


There are two levels of learning about parenting and sexuality—one level is finding the information you need to be a better parent, whatever that means to you: your child is more safe, more happy, you make life easier for yourself or worry less, whatever is most important to you. Just as a parent wants to learn if a particular type of discipline is effective, or practical information, like if a certain brand of bicycle is sturdy, they want to learn what’s the right age to talk about puberty. There are many people who want all the practical information but also need to know how to talk to their kids about sex. So they ask not “What do I say?” so much as “How do I talk about it?”

It’s one thing to talk to your partner, a prospective lover, a helping professional, or an adult friend about sex, and something else altogether to talk freely to your children. Someone that’s completely cavalier about sex in a grown-up context might be one who freezes up when questioned about sex by a child.

What’s our answer to the big how? Just answer the question! Answer instead of avoiding it; answer the question as best as you can. In general, kids will ask age-appropriate questions; below we’ll give you some guidelines covering the ages when most kids will start getting curious about various things. Answer the question they ask, not the question they’re likely to ask in four years. You don’t have to pile on all the knowledge from your college sex ed class—answer the specific question that engaged your child’s curiosity.





Attitude


Smile, relax, and try to present a neutral, adult, positive and informative tone. Mirror the level with which you would discuss something that isn’t about sex. If you aren’t naturally feeling comfortable, fake it. Think of something else that wouldn’t make you nervous. For example, you might be more natural when teaching a child how to bake a cake: “To make a yummy cake we do this and stir in that.” You would also point out, “But let a grown-up open the oven door.” For that part you might stop smiling to state clearly and seriously that this is a firm boundary that has to do with safety. Sex conversations work the same way.

Talk about it like it’s a natural part of life that your child has every right to be curious about. Now let’s go into some whats­­—as in, “What do I talk about?”





The Talk is Actually Many Talks:

What Age & Which Words


Children are individuals. One child might ask about childbirth over and over again while another may not ask at all. Our list is general, and hopefully will give you some ideas. Our resource list includes books that go into further detail.

Age 0 to 2: During their entire lives, talk about love, human sexuality and gender without shame or embarrassment.

Always use the correct anatomical terms for body parts. There is never a “first age” for discussing the names of body parts. A knee is a knee and a penis is a penis whether you are 5 months old or 105 years old.

Ages 2 to 3: Again, use correct words for body parts. Children at this age often notice adults or parents kissing and showing affection. It’s an opportunity to assert that love or partnering (or how ever you want to word it) are important to most folks. Some children need to be reassured by their parent, “I love you and I love this adult (co-parent, father, mother, etc.) too. Grown-up love is important and it’s OK for me to kiss them.”

Ages 3 to 4: Tummy versus uterus time! It’s natural for kids to think about babies because they are often around pregnant people or people with small children. Some experts suggest saying uterus instead of tummy (we said to use correct names, didn’t we?). It’s up to you, though. A preschooler pointing to a belly has no idea there are organs in there. Some children this age freak out seeing their own blood or from flushing poop down the toilet. There are fun cartoons showing “where your food goes” and other facts about anatomy—showing your kids these images can’t start too early.

In their pre-school years, children are also seeing other children’s bodies. Joani Blank[iv], the founder of Good Vibrations and the author of A Kid’s First Book About Sex, asserts that it’s important to remember that the proper name for girl parts is vulva, not vagina. “The vulva is what we can see on the outside. She can see it and name it when the boys say ‘I’ve got a penis—what do you have?’ The little girl can clearly see she has something too!” “A vagina,” Blank continues, “is a hole and cannot, by definition, be seen. Vagina is more popular than vulva because of generations of good old-fashioned sexism.” We’ve said proper names are important and that’s as true for girls as for anyone else, so for now, clearly name their outer anatomy.

Ages 4 to 5: Interest in childbirth might still be the hot topic. Now it’s moved to “How does the baby get out?” Be precise: “When babies are born they are pushed out through their mommy’s vagina which is sometimes called birth canal.” They also might ask how did it get into the mommy’s body. Pulling out a copy of Cory Silverberg’s What Makes a Baby to read together can save the day. For now we’ll give you the short answer: “The baby started out very very tiny and grew inside the mommy so her belly could stretch slowly.” If they want more, see below.

Ages 5 to 6: Gender is big and happening for real now. “Sometimes we feel like a boy and sometimes we feel like a girl,” can work for many situations and has no judgment attached. Kids appreciate simplicity and no shame. Also, most children are having a love affair with their own bodies at this age. After all, now their bodies are really starting to deliver: they can run, be independent, be strong lifters, reachers and more. Most kids love looking in the mirror, as they are often fascinated by growth and change.

Ages 6 to 7: This age is when they really want to know how babies are made. “Sperm comes out of adult men and if grown-ups are having sexual intercourse then it can go into a woman through her vagina and make a baby. But babies and families are made in lots of ways. This is the main way, but there are others.” If you ask them what they think, this is the age that you will get some funny quotes for the scrapbook!

By now they will be circling back with more questions, following on those from earlier years. Maybe you had an interesting conversation when they were three, and now they bring it up again. You thought you covered it, or it might even happen in a public place when your child shocks you with a statement that doesn’t seem to fit. No worries, it’s natural to revisit big topics many times as they see it from different angles, or remember only one or two pieces of information, or have an interest in a different aspect than they found interesting before.

Ages 8 to 9: Time to get real. Sex and sexual intercourse are subjects of curiosity at this age, and they have heard about rape or will hear about it soon. They may not understand what rape is, however; if you find yourself having to explain it before you have discussed intercourse, remember to clearly differentiate the two and emphasize that one way to understand the difference is by considering what someone desires to experience or share—basically here you are talking about consent, and you have likely had opportunities to speak about this when your kids were even younger, in discussing unwanted touch. You might be tempted to put off this topic as well as many others “until they get older,” but actually this is the time to slow down and talk about it. Why? One important reason is that you want them to hear the answer from you. What if your child thinks they can’t talk to you and they search “rape” on a computer at school or at home? What will they see? Dimes to dollars, we bet they won’t read the answer—they will pick the first video that comes up on the search engine. So again: This is the age to address all their questions. Repeatedly say, “You can always ask me anything,” and mean it.

You might be saying, “This will scare my children,” and you are right. So along with explaining anything that could scare your child (from tornadoes to rape), go over what your family does to protect them: “That’s why Mommy and Mama (Mommy and Daddy, or Daddy and Papa) always protect you and we teach you how to protect yourself. We use our brains, we listen to our instincts. We protect you in ways like going to the bathroom with you, arranging for you to take karate, and we have locks on the door” (or whatever you want to reassure them with).

Most kids hear about oral sex around age 9 or 10, from other kids or from the media. Oftentimes they specifically ask, “What is a blowjob?” Here’s an answer you might choose to offer: “Some people kiss on genitals and think it feels good. It’s called ‘oral sex.’ Right now you are at the age where you can touch yourself and your own private parts, but children don’t do oral sex. Some grownups have oral sex and some don’t. Some people think that gay people have more oral sex, but that’s not true either.” Convey the message that whatever kind of sex grownups want to have with grownups is up to them and is private. Be forewarned, a kid’s response is frequently “Eww!” Shar says, “I shrug and say, ‘Yep, but them’s the facts.’ Life is a journey and we like different things at different times in our lives. No use in rushing childhood; you will be a grownup forever and ever after childhood is over!”

With oral sex and intercourse on the table for discussion, this is the age when kids can be told that people have both experiences because they like the way it feels—sex isn’t just for reproduction, and some people never reproduce. Sometimes kids ask, “If they don’t have sex to make babies then why do they do it?” As Shar likes to say, “It’s one way grownups have fun.”

Ages 9 to 11: Puberty! Puberty begins to enter the school-age vernacular for a variety of reasons, including kids’ own changing bodies and beginning to notice changes in others. Most people think puberty means reproductive capacity and/or sexuality, but in this context we’re talking only about physical changes, like breast development, possibly some tiny pimples and the sprouting of pubic hair. While some kids enter puberty earlier or later, age 9 to 11 is average. (Nowadays some girls enter puberty much earlier; see The New Puberty: How to Navigate Early Development in Today’s Girls, by Louise Greenspan, MD and Julianna Deardorff, PhD.)

Body changes: Tell them about menstruation, and about erections—including that they may possibly happen when a boy doesn’t want them. These experiences can start early and you don’t want them to panic. Present this information in a matter-of-fact way; remember, kids are always going through body changes—losing teeth, growing feet—and don’t see it as cataclysmic or dramatic.

Age 12: Be sure to discuss emotions if you haven’t already—nowadays this could be relevant as early as age 10. You don’t need to let your child’s emotions be your emotions. If you get overly worried or involved in pre-teen drama, the joke’s on you. Most of the time they’ve made up with their frenemies and are best friends again while you’ve bought every “tween” book on the market to prepare a soothing speech! But this is an important time to keep your ears open. Let them talk it out if they will talk with you. Sit on the end of the bed and just hang out or stand in the doorway of their bedroom—be available. Discuss anything that could affect their self-esteem and therefore health or safety. This includes sexual orientation, desires, peer or personal expectations, body size or body image, date rape, and unsafe situations. Discuss your definition of “morally upstanding” and how to be an upstander instead of a bystander. Help them find the words and concepts to think about serious sexual issues and to talk about them—with you and with their friends. For the girls especially, but for anyone having a more passive personality, practice the phrase, “Nobody talks to me that way!” and reinforce that they can leave an uncomfortable situation and that no one has the right to pressure them.

End of 12 to 13: Be loud and clear—and no stuttering!—on all things STI-related. Show them pictures if you want to. Talk and talk, tell them to masturbate, tell them how all parts of their body can feel excited when aroused. If you are feeling squeamish about discussing masturbation as an option, you might be interested to learn that Dr. Joycelyn Elders lowered the Arkansas teen pregnancy rate during her tenure in the state because she led the charge of sex education in schools that included offering masturbation as a sexual option and of course safer sex information and supplies. Elders says that “vows of abstinence break more easily than condoms.” Tell them that sexual intercourse is not the end-all be-all for heterosexuals, anal sex is not had by all gay men, and all girls don’t give blowjobs. Your teens might even start thinking, “Sex must be boring if your parents talk about it!”

Make sure you cover STIs, pregnancy, embodiment, morals, alternatives to anything that causes disease or pregnancy, masturbation, exploration, discussing whether they like doing something, acknowledging their youth and enjoying being a kid.

Repeat all this information twice a year at least until your child is 23. Do it quarterly if you feel the need.





More For Your Mindful Mini-Van of Parenting Conversations


Here’s a parenting metaphor: Whether it’s on purpose, like a perfectly stocked First Aid kit, or purposely ignored, like the dirty sweatshirt under the seat that will save the day if they get cold, many parents have the mini-van packed with enough supplies to survive a minor disaster! And it’s more than a metaphor, since sometimes deep conversations happen while we are driving to theatre or soccer practice. So here are some thoughts to help keep your parenting-and-sexuality mini-van mindset stocked just as well as your ready-for-anything car.





Be A Leader About Family Values


Use words that reinforce your family’s values. Family pride gives the children pride. Articulating your family’s values and morals helps give them a voice when they or their friends experience prejudice, unhealthy circumstances, or misinformation. When you do this, make clear your family’s feelings about various issues so as to model differing views and diversity of family experience as well. Not all families feel the same about all issues related to sex, gender, identities, and relationships, and your child will certainly encounter other kids whose families have different perspectives and beliefs about these things.

Here are some examples:

“In our family, we can talk to each other about anything.”

“In our family, we aren’t afraid to say no if we don’t like something.”

“In our family, we love having fun and think that’s important!”

“In our family, we stand up against bullies.”

“In our family we know about healthy sexuality and we talk about any questions we have about sex.”

So think about your own values and aspirations or wishes for the future when it comes to sexual health and happiness—not just for yourself and your partner, but for your offspring, when they reach that stage in life. What do you prioritize in your family?





Set Your Boundaries and Claim Them


Instead of putting something onto a child, be clear if it’s about you—a kid is not responsible for your own feelings about sexual issues. You can always add “I” to a sentence and own what you are saying. At the same time, don’t feel bad about setting a boundary. For example: Since you do not want your child masturbating while in bed next to you, in the living room, or any place where others can observe, speak up: “I want you to have privacy when doing that, would you like to go into your room now or save that for later?” It’s perfectly appropriate to want to reinforce this kind of privacy for your kids, but don’t do it by shaming the behavior or the child—many an adult with sexual problems traces them back to being shamed for childhood masturbating. Kids admire and look up to their parents so much and want to please them, so it’s really important not to use shame as a method or excuse for boundary-setting.





Transgender Discussion


Transgender conversations will come up for your kids regardless of whether or not they are trans. Gendering happens to kids on a daily basis, and children are often acutely interested in gender and gender roles. For the safety of our family and friends and for the greater call of equality for all, it’s essential to clearly support transgender people. If you are a trans-identified parent you may feel comfortable or at least practiced in these discussions. On the other hand, you might not. Do you want to reveal things that happened to you when you were your child’s age and how they helped or hurt you? Or how you could have made a situation better? How do you do things differently now that you are a parent? You might want to talk about some of these memories and ideas with friends before discussing with your children, or you might feel confident jumping right into the conversation.

To everyone we suggest you support those around you openly, and if you do not know someone transgender or who’s out about being trans, then use moments in the media to share your support of transgender children and adults. It’s not hard to find a news story about a trans child or adult that will spark conversation. You can state that you are proud of families that stick together, that you are happy when children can talk to their parents and get support. How will your kids know you feel that way unless you express yourself loud and clear? Depending on the age of your kids, do not mince words about the difficulty of the situation. “It’s not easy to be transgender in our world. So we always need to have an eye out for how we can help [and whatever else you want to express].” In the end you may be saving your own child’s life or, in the least, you are raising a strong, compassionate person who in turn may be the support for someone else’s child who’s struggling.





Start Discussions Before They Start Without You


Previous generations had the luxury of debating whether they wanted to discuss sexual topics openly with their children versus turning a blind eye to a teen learning (supposedly) the facts of life from a Playboy passed around school. Where you would sit on that debate matters very little these days, because as we mentioned, kids go right to the Internet for answers, where you will have no control over what they see. We suggest bringing up topics in your way, on your terms, providing plenty of educational books. Go to websites together, then sneak away and give them privacy. Scarleteen.com’s subtitle is “Sex Education for the Real World” with good reason. They address teens and also have a “for parents” area. And they don’t just focus on the so-called “birds and the bees,” they take on real-world concerns and are pleasure-positive.





Be Aware of What You Say & What You Don’t Say


Pay attention to your words around anything that has to do with sexuality, including how women and others dress. Never presume that your children know you disagree or agree with a particular sexual value. Simply having one of those TV entertainment news shows on gives you an opportunity to talk about social mores and prejudice, like the pressure people feel to act a certain way or be judged. Watch how you speak about people and concepts like “sluttiness.” Discuss openly why women in videos or commercials are depicted in a sexual way but the men often are not. Why bring this up? Are we being too political? No, actually, children have an innate sense of equality and fairness. Who more than a child says, “That’s not fair!”? They sense it is wrong when they see others shamed, or depicted in an unfair manner; they might even feel embarrassed or internalize feelings of humiliation. Discussions show that you know when something is unfair too. In older children these conversations and awareness can help avert poor self-esteem and support your child’s trust in you. Lastly, taking the time to call these things out models to your children that you think this stuff is so important you talk about it. That alone is an empowerment tool that will serve them—and those who love them—well in the future!





Sex is Sex


Kids often hear or surmise that having sex makes babies, and, without any help from you, they may conclude that’s the only reason people have sex. We’ve heard many anecdotes from folks who’ve experienced some version of this. In one instance, two children got upset that their parents were having sex not out of a sense of sexual shame, but because, as the youngest cried, “You are making babies without telling us! You didn’t ask me if I wanted a baby!” The parents tried to get their little darlings calmed down by insisting that wasn’t true, but stumbling—trying to find the words to explain that they had sex for many other reasons. This reinforces our advice to tell your kids what you know about sex on the early side, on your own terms—when discussing sex be clear that it’s sex, not making babies.





How Babies are Made versus How a Family is Made


It’s usually at about 6 or 7 years old that kids start asking “For real, how are babies made? Where do they come from?” Oftentimes this is accompanied by a glare that conveys a child’s version of “…and by the way, don’t BS me!” This is the time to put on your Dr. Mom or Dr. Dad hat and tell them which body parts will make sperm and eggs when they are older. If you’ve been teaching names of body parts and functions from birth, kids will be ready to hear this. Depending on the child’s age and curiosity, this can go into how the sperm and egg merge, which leads most people to sexual intercourse and marriage or love and can also go into donating sperm or creating families in alternative ways.

Babies and families are made all sorts of ways. Children get the message, from the playground, songs on the radio to their favorite Disney movie, that babies come from married male and female couples. Some parents who consider themselves open-minded will be shocked that their gay friends come over and their child says, “You can’t be married!” This is the child’s way of saying, “People get married to have a family, and only a man and a woman can make a baby.” Time to start talking to those children about sex and diverse family constellations!

We need heads held high and no shame when we talk about these issues, especially when we explain difference and diversity. Loud and clear.

There are single parents who use donated sperm or eggs; there are LGBTQQ parents, and of course adoption is common. An easy way to explain adoption is to say, Adoption happens so adults can be parents, and kids can have parents. Sometimes grandparents or aunts and uncles adopt children in their family when a birth parent can’t take care of the child. Of course, when they are older you can add much to that.

Being inclusive right from the start about the ways people create family is important. You will probably spend more time talking about the many ways babies and parents come together than you do about biology. Include adoption, foster care, friends donating sperm as well as insemination clinics, kinship care, extended families and anything you can think of.

Here’s the deal—they will not remember everything and will circle back with more questions later. Does that mean you shouldn’t tell it all? No, go for broke. Shar says, “I advocate for telling a multitude of possibilities so that even if they get confused or forget, it’s in their brains: ‘Hey, there are so many kinds of families and wonderful ways to make a family I can’t even remember them all!’” Which counterbalances the message that there is only one kind of family made one kind of way. You will be giving a more accurate reflection of our world.





Protecting Kids


Pay attention to changes in temperament for kids of all ages, as this is the first sign that your child may be getting bullied, has been date raped or molested, has suffered social media attacks or had another negative experience. Follow them to school, show up and surprise them for lunch, go to a therapist, do what you need to do to protect and care for and heal your child. Do not wait for a suicide attempt to happen.





Should Your Children Get the HPV Vaccine?


If you’re an adult with HPV (human papillomavirus), you may already know that what seemed to be a pesky but insignificant bug the decade you got it is now considered a possible precursor to cancer. It has been linked to cancers of the throat, cervix, vagina, vulva and anus—just about any mucosal part of the body might be at risk, if that body part has participated in unprotected sexual contact with a partner who has the virus. If you don’t have it, please take our word for it that at least some of the many strains of this STI are not an insignificant bother, but a serious reason to see your doctor regularly. And if you don’t know whether you have it, perhaps a trip to the doctor is in order. You can’t go back in time and un-catch HPV—but you can vaccinate your kids against it and urge your friends with pre-teens to do the same. Gardasil, the HPV vaccine approved for girls and boys—and, presumably, everyone else—is given in three doses over a six-month period; to be fully protected, a young person must have all three doses. The vaccines are recommended for people at an early age, 11 or 12, so that full protection is already established before someone becomes sexually active. Yes, we know, most young people do not begin having sex that early; the Centers for Disease Control knows this too, and recommends the vaccine up to age 26 for youth who were not vaccinated as pre-teens. The reason for the very young age is to try, to the greatest degree possible, to eliminate the virus in one generation so that it will not be a silent killer into our children’s adulthoods. Just as some non-STI diseases like polio and measles have been the target of vaccination campaigns and were knocked back or eradicated, this is a public health attempt to stop HPV once and for all—and if all young people were vaccinated, this would be an achievable goal. Unfortunately, some parents feel early vaccination somehow gives youth permission to have sex; they ask, “What message is this sending?” We wish they would understand the broader principles of herd immunity. Remember—getting a tetanus shot doesn’t give your kids the message to run outside and jump on rusty nails!





Diving into the Deep End: For Parents New to Talking to Teens


For those jumping into the deep water straightaway—meaning that you haven’t discussed sex with your kids and they are in puberty or their teen years: First of all, bravo to you. Presuming you were reticent or even afraid to do “the talk,” this means you are summoning up even more courage than many other parents, so pat yourself on the back!

Our earlier advice assumes perfect conditions like access and openness from birth, but we’re here to support you now.

Be honest. Say something like, “I want to acknowledge that I wish I had talked to you sooner about sexuality. It’s a little difficult for me to bring up the topic but I am here now. Sex is important to humans. Healthy sex is very important to know about. Guessing what to do in many situations can be dangerous or unhealthy if it leads to doing the wrong thing, so I want to share what I know even if you think you already know it.” And always—no matter what your speech is—underline and add, “You can always ask me something or talk to me about it. We can even look it up together if I don’t know the latest.” Good Luck! Remember, don’t be shy about repeating yourself—it does go into their brains even if they don’t show it!





Changing the Cycle of Sexual Shame, Fear and Embarrassment


If you are a parent, might become one, or have children close in your lives, then you have the wonderful opportunity to shut down shame. Being a sexually healthy role model is the best thing you can do for yourself and your kids, no matter what your relationship status and sexual identity.

Have clear boundaries and stand up for yourself if being treated badly by someone—anyone, not necessarily someone in a love relationship—as this will model boundaries and self-respect. Model hearing yes and no. Model asking. Part of basic parenting is remembering to not make something a question that the child doesn’t have a choice about, like going to school. But if it’s something like going to the ice cream parlor vs. going to Yogurt Palace, then use that opportunity to model disagreement and resolution, and having a backbone so your child learns that others have feelings too. Say, “I want ice cream and you want yogurt. Whatever can we do to solve this conundrum?” Have fun working it out.

Are you asking why such basic advice is in a sex book? Because seizing the moment, as above, shows that pleasure is very much worthy of discussion, limits are heard, desires are asked for and planned, and negotiation is possible. That modeling of relationships—your love relationships as well as yours and the child’s—does more than a lecture about a future boyfriend or girlfriend ever will.

When it comes to sex: Your kids can and probably should know that you have sex. You don’t have to over-share and give them specifics, but being clear that you need and enjoy your own privacy and pleasure sets the precedent that quality relationships and self-care are an everyday, expected part of life. It shows them that a healthy sex life is important and that you value it. There’s nothing wrong with locking the bedroom door and enjoying yourself when the children are asleep or safely occupied.





Entering the Dating Scene After Divorce


Most people run the gamut of emotions after divorce. Some feel incredibly free and want to dance on the mountaintops; some feel abandoned or unwanted; and some just feel confused and sad. They did not plan this. They had a wedding and thought they’d be married forever. Now they find themselves in a new situation, maybe without a Plan B.

Some are simply exhausted by the circumstances, the ups and downs, and the new financial realities that come with separation. If children are involved, everything’s even more complicated. There’s no question that however breaking up makes you feel, from relieved to devastated—and sometimes maybe even both at the same time—it is a stressful major life change: You must find ways to take care of yourself so you can move forward and see what life holds for you next.

Seek out support as well as information. Hopefully you can lean on your friends and family. You need and want and should get validation and even education during this transformative time. You might be saying, “What’s there to learn? I don’t need a book to know I’m divorced.” But there’s something to be said for knowing that others have gone through the same experiences and feelings. It’s validating and might even present a different perspective on the matter. Bookstores and libraries are chock full of books addressing the myriad of divorce situations, and support groups abound.

If you are a parent you might welcome suggestions on how and when to introduce someone new to the family, and what limitations/boundaries you might want.

Don’t be too hard on yourself if you are a little clumsy in social situations or your emotions seem to have a will of their own. One moment you might want to strip on the tabletops and the next hide in a corner. If a friend was going through a divorce, you would be supportive, forgiving, kind, comforting and encouraging—wouldn’t you? Treat yourself as well as you would treat a friend!





It’s Time to Re-Discover Yourself!


Earlier we asked, “Who are you as a sexual individual?” Post-divorce or break-up is the perfect time to explore who you really are, or who you have become over the course of your previous relationship. First, what is it that you want out of dating? Sex or companionship? Or both? Many friends will talk to you about the rebound effect, which happens when someone rushes too quickly into a new relationship after a previous one ends. Odds are you should listen to them and build time in your life, at least for a while, that is just about you. Volunteer for a cause you’re passionate about, learn yoga or jazz dance, sign up for a seminar series—or take a class at a sex toy store! You don’t want to end up in a new yet unsatisfying sexual partnership simply because you are looking for companionship. What if you stay open-minded and keep some nights of the week free for exploration? What if you are completely open and honest with a new companion about what you want to try sexually? In other words, don’t go from the frying pan into the fire—and don’t just cook that same old dish all over again! This is a time for you to learn from your experiences: the things you miss about your previous relationship, and the things you missed during it.

Instead of deciding the answers to these questions right this minute, give yourself time to ponder the many questions relevant to your life and desires. To find the right person you want to be honest about who you are, but first, decide what it is you want to explore—that will help you find the right person or people with whom to explore it.





Time Train Exercise


Fold a piece of paper longways down the middle

On the left:

	 Make a list of what you liked sexually in your married/partnered sex life when (or if) you had sex. Be specific.

Make a list of ways that you felt misunderstood or your desires were not heard. For our purposes limit this to sex—though you might want to do it a second time, addressing other interpersonal issues and unmet needs. “I bought a paddle but never got spanked.” Or, “When I told her to roll over it was really because my leg hurt and I needed a better position.”

What do I wish I could change?

How might those changes be possible? Like: “I should be with a person who really listens to me.” Or: “I could speak up and say why I’d like to do something differently.”





	Now on the right half of the page, across from the above:

	 Write affirmations that help you focus on what you want. “I will never date someone who doesn’t give head”… whatever! You choose what’s important to you. Then put stars next to it!

Erase past actions connected to a specific person. Then open-mindedly think of ways to be proactive and get what you want, or at least open the door to that activity. Maybe it’s “I will bring up spanking in casual conversation when I am newly dating someone.” Or, “Right before sex I will tell dates that I have to change positions after a few minutes because of my bursitis. They don’t have to worry about my pain because I will just say – ‘Hey, time to switch around!’”

If appropriate, consider what started your bad time around any problems you listed. Did you fake orgasms? Did you fight about bills, then find you didn’t want to have sex? Did you fight in front of the kids? Did you call each other names? Whatever it is, take time to close your eyes and picture a time-train, and on this train you can walk back through the cars to the engine, slowly looking around at each car. What started the issue? Where is the beginning? Now, if possible, think of walking back through the cars, and seeing them differently. Acknowledging what you want, or recognizing the genesis of your problem, has changed your trip from car to car. Hey, maybe you’ll get off that train altogether now! Or maybe you will drive it differently or change its route.





There’s dating and then there’s sex. Do you want to get to the sex part soon, like right now? Are you feeling pent up because you didn’t have the kind or amount of sex you wanted in your previous marriage or relationship? Are you afraid of sex with someone new because you were intimate with only your spouse for many years? Do you feel savvy once you’re in bed, but worried about navigating the dating scene itself?

While you may not have had to deal with it in many years, when you separate and begin seeing new people, safe sex is important. HIV can be managed healthily for decades; not getting it in the first place is still the best strategy, but the HIV epidemic is different from the way it was in the 1980s. Like that pesky annual flu, viruses mutate and risks change. For example, gonorrhea was once easily cured with medication, but now has become antibiotic-resistant. In the past, genital warts did not cause much alarm; now we know they are caused by the human papillomavirus, and some strains can lead to cervical cancer or other complications if not taken seriously. Give yourself safety and peace of mind by using lube and condoms and other safe sex measures. Be honest with your doctor about any risks (and/or questions about risk) you may have, and get tested regularly. Do you have chlamydia? Find out before you spread it to others or it turns into PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, an often painful pelvic condition that can affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries when an infection moves up the vaginal canal through the cervix). For help having successful safer sex go here.





Privacy Issues and Testing


Getting tested for STIs is a good reminder of how important safer sex is, and it helps protect you and your partners; but some people resist it because of privacy concerns. Different locales have varying regulations and laws about testing. Ask your doctor to explain them, or get tested at a clinic that may be more likely to keep its records private. If it’s an option for you, you may want to get tested at an anonymous clinic elsewhere. As of this writing, some states have laws making it illegal for HIV-positive people to have sex; we might wish to argue about whether that’s a wise move, but since it affects the lives and choices of people who are positive, it might well be a factor in your decision-making.





The bottom line in a situation like a break-up or divorce: You must take care of yourself, but use this opportunity to know yourself. Partners change together; your opportunity now is to understand that change, return to some of the interests or priorities of your pre-partnered self, or let the new self out to play and enjoy life in a whole new way. You are only as good for another person as you are good for yourself.

Use this time of rebirth to create the sex-positive attitude that will help you achieve the sex life you crave. Like real birth, it won’t always be easy—there might be some crying, ranting, and deep pain—but once you are out of the tight spot it can be a whole new world. The end of something can be the beginning of something just as significant, and an opportunity to create a transition into greater interpersonal comfort and pleasure.





Sober Sex a.k.a. Wild & Crazy Sex—that you actually remember!


What does it take for you to feel sexually free and ready to get it on? Maybe a lock on the door and a hunk in the bed? A babe at the ready and an open Saturday night? Do you think of a bottle of wine, some lines or a bump, and then some hot groping in the dark? Many experts think our society has a problem in that so many people mix sex up with drugs and alcohol, and there are days when we definitely agree with them. It’s one thing to welcome a group of joyous, super-tipsy women into our store as they shop, also known as “brandish vibes at each other, slap each other on the ass with paddles, and squeal with laughter as they encounter each toy section.” It’s another to see a couple who can barely walk come in—fortified with drinks because that’s what it took for them to get the courage to come in at all. We worry whether they’ll remember any care, cleaning, and safety information we gave them once they’re home and the toy comes out of its packaging. We see single shoppers fortified with liquid courage, too.



A friend of ours met and flirted with a woman at an AA meeting. It soon seemed likely they were going to have sex. He realized that he was terrified, and was getting nervous and worked up about it. But he didn’t put two and two together and realize his fear was connected to getting sober—obvious in the telling now, but he just hadn’t made the connection. Somehow she sensed what he was feeling and acknowledged it. He needed to back up and slow down and acknowledge what a big step it was to have sex without alcohol or drugs—just his ability to be with a lover and feel how he really felt was such a leap.

She had been clean longer than he had, and told him that she too was terrified the first time she had sober sex. When she said that, it suddenly hit him that this was indeed what he was feeling, and he was grateful that she got it. It helped him relax, and everything went well. We asked whether he thought it was important to have sex with another sober person to feel safe. And he said not so much, that once he recognized the terror was connected to sobriety, not to sex, he was fine regardless of whether or not a partner was sober.

He wanted to tell us this story in order to help people, to acknowledge the fear so newly sober-sex people don’t run back to the bottle because the feelings are overwhelming. Give yourself a break, go slow, once you acknowledge it’s scary, it can become less scary—at least it did for him. Being able to have sex while sober—as one book calls it, “making love while conscious”—can help repair shame and damage.





Our society does us a great disservice when we’re adolescents: It sends the message that two of the most significant milestones to adulthood are sex and access to booze, but it tends not to give adequate education about either. That means even young people who aren’t druggies or heavy drinkers are likely to have early sexual experiences under the influence, at a party or a friend’s house. Drugs and alcohol are great disinhibitors, giving people the nerve to be adventurous in various ways, including sexually. That this has its downside is hardly a secret.

Listen, we’re not trying to shake any fingers here. We just care about the quality of your sex life. As such, we want to make sure you know some of the issues that can affect your experience when drugs and/or alcohol are used in concert with sex. After we do that, we’re going to accentuate the positive and say more about what’s good about sober sex.

Even if you don’t party, please read this section anyway, on behalf of your friends who do.

Issues and concerns with sex and substance use:

	 	 Alcohol and many drugs may make you feel frisky and uninhibited, but they are neural suppressants. They can get in the way of erection, arousal, lubrication, sensation, and climax. You may believe you’re having—whooo!—hot sex, but your body might not agree—and you might be too wasted to read its signals.

Mind-altering substances can affect your ability to make responsible decisions and to communicate your desires and limits. This has many possible side effects, including: Saying yes when you wouldn’t say yes if sober; not taking no for an answer or caring/recognizing whether consent has been given—and we should probably spell out that this can lead to sexual abuse or rape; forgetting about safer sex; forgetting to mention salient issues like STI status, marital status, etc.; unintended pregnancy or catching an STI.

Some people mask deep issues and feelings with substances, including sexual orientation; gender identity; history of sexual or other abuse. Essentially, instead of getting targeted support, they are self-medicating—which distracts them from getting real help.

Some people, likewise, mask issues like low self-esteem by having sex, and substances definitely can facilitate doing this—especially when your “sober self” is shy and introverted by nature and not exactly a big flirt.

In a culture that entertains itself with sex, including industrial-level sex gossip about celebrities, we are also full of judgment, and a mix of sex and substances can leave a person—especially women and LGBTQQ people—open to slut-shaming, queer-shaming, bullying, and sometimes stalking and violence. Sure, this can happen to a sober person, but when taking your sexuality out to party you are bringing it into an atmosphere where others might have fewer inhibitions acting out their own mixed feelings about sexuality.

One’s own boundaries shift; when we were young and restless, we used the phrase “drunk-dialing”—a twist on “drunk-driving”—to describe those sloppy phone calls to and from ex-lovers and lover-wannabes—hopefully forgettable unless they went into voicemail. Then the joke became drunk-texting, and then social media—words are bad enough, but now they can include pictures and videos as well. So instead of a slurred embarrassing conversation over the phone, we can awaken the morning after to evidence of our lust/horniness/anger/desperation—oh, let’s add in goodies like unrequited love, too—all over the Internet, never to be erased. This can not only be embarrassing but can affect our personal and professional reputations in a significant way. Sure, it’s possible one could exercise poor judgment of this kind while sober too, but c’mon—look at those pictures.



Now, as stated, we’re not trying to shut down the party. Unless you have a problem with substances that you cannot moderate on your own, we’re not sending the waiter over to take away your glass.

But we do want to issue a challenge. If sex is so enjoyable and fabulous, then why would we fuzz ourselves out in order to engage in it? It often happens that when a person decides to lighten up on the bottle or the drugs, they realize something they never before noticed: They’re a little bit afraid to get sexual without that crutch. Or they get it that the kind of sex they’ve been having bears little or no resemblance to the kind of sex they really want to have. Other times, it’s when a person is grappling with issues of sexual dysfunction that this issue comes up. When the therapist or sex coach does an intake and finds out that anorgasmia or erectile issues are likely related to a person’s drug or alcohol use, it can be reason enough to prioritize pleasure over partying.

People we know who have gotten clean and sober say their sexual and emotional skill set can revert to the age they were when they started drinking or getting high: Imagine all of a sudden being fourteen again! Here’s the good news: Actual fourteen-year-olds get through it, with a little less pain if they have sex-positive parents empowering them, and so do older adults who start anew to develop healthier and more functional social skills. Let us help empower you.

Here’s what you can add to your life by de-linking sex and substances:

You get the full use of your nerve endings for one of the nervous system’s supreme experiences: arousal and orgasm!

You remove the possibility of becoming dependent on mood-altering substances in order to have sex.

You can be much more aware of a partner’s compatibility with you, and develop an enhanced understanding of what you want and need out of sex.

You will be better equipped to communicate and to hear others’ communication—this will have huge implications in both boundary-setting, including safety negotiations, and getting your own desires met.

You’re all set to move to the next level of intimacy and intentionality in your sex life: the state in which you can determine what you need to learn and develop greater comfort about, claim your own unique identity without shame, and explore choices in your sex and love life fully conscious.



We say: Cheers to that!



Read this chapter no matter how old you are. It will be relevant sooner or later, and we assure you, that beats many of the alternatives.





Sexy Senior Years



With self-knowledge, creativity, good communication, and a sense of humor, we can roll with the changes and make the Earth move again.

	—Joan Price





As this book winds to a close, we want to affirm the sexuality of those who are living the closing chapters of remarkable—or ordinary—lives. We don’t get enough of this message in our society; we think this is important.

A caveat: Ask any group of seniors about sex—their questions, their challenges, their solutions to issues, their thoughts and hopes—and you’ll get just as many different answers as you would from a group of 30-year-olds. In the first part of this book we stressed that each of us is a sexual individual. We pointed out that our human experience can’t be contained on a continuum along just one straight line (“mark zero for totally heterosexual and six for totally homosexual”), but instead can be described via many continua. But even that is too linear! Perhaps we should be thinking not of a continuum, or more than one, but a spectrum or many, and not on a straight line but a wave.

When it comes to aging, specific issues like changing desire, erectile dysfunction, limited mobility, relationship endings or changes, and vaginal dryness have already been covered in previous sections. If you counted heads, you might find more people who are 60+ with some of these problems or challenges, but there would also be many who are younger. Solutions, or at least helpful tips, to those issues are found throughout the book, including Sexy Setbacks or our discussions on disability, rather than ghettoized as only age-related. We even included “Silver Polyamory” in the poly section, since some people see creative open relationships as a solution to aging or healthcare issues, in addition to being their preferred way of love and/or sex-partnering. So don’t be shy—search and find the topics that apply to you.





How No Desire for Sex Could Save Your Life


Sexual concerns can save your life if they send you to your doctor or counselor for help. If you’ve experienced changes of desire or changes—for the worse—in your sexual abilities, see your doctor immediately. It might not be hormones, a mid-life crisis or anything to do with your partner; it could be a symptom of a life-threatening illness. Talk frankly about the changes. Some MDs will not address sexuality unless you bring it up. If the doc seems uncomfortable, ask why; depending on their reply, you may need to consider changing doctors. Note: If you have been on meds, ask the doctor whether that medication is known to have sexual side effects; many do. Check hormone levels, too; some women will feel better on HRT (hormone replacement therapy), but try not to use synthetic hormones. Many health care providers feel strongly that bioidentical hormones, which can be sourced from plants, not just animal sources, are a more healthful alternative.





Now, back to sexuality during the last decades of life! How do you and your partner deal with growing older and our changing bodies, changing desires and changing mental attitudes? The answer is to communicate openly and be willing to experiment. As sex educators, how do we know this? We get the answer straight from the source—from the many people who have told us their stories, not to mention the thousands who have shared their stories with Joan Price, author of Naked At Any Age and other books that explore and celebrate elder sex. In her books Price details the concerns and challenges shared by seniors from around the world. One theme, especially, emerges: Keep an open mind. Instead of focusing on what you can’t do, be creative about figuring out what you can do.

If you are a senior, perhaps we don’t even have to tell you this! We know you’ve figured it out when it comes to opening jars and navigating the Internet, so why not sex?

Cherish the whole you: Consider your whole-body health: exercise, stop smoking, don’t drink or do other substances to excess, watch out for fatty foods. These are all “lifestyle changes” that may forestall the need to take Viagra or other medications that can chemically support sexual functioning, and remember that, to date, there are no such pharmaceuticals for women—though at some point there almost certainly will be. Most people find that midlife and later-life dietary changes are called for—our metabolisms just aren’t what they used to be; also, food allergies can crop up during this time, and even these can sometimes affect libido. Keep cholesterol at healthy levels and diabetes at bay—hopefully before you need medication.

Be Honest: Start with yourself! Is there so much interpersonal stress in your relationship that it blocks your desire for sex? If you do have problems with a partner, they won’t magically improve on their own. Address those midlife or later-life issues that may be exacerbating the problem, like stress, alcohol use, depression, etc. Perhaps now is the time to consider therapy.

Speak Up: Even if you’ve been with your soul mate for fifty years, we bet they can’t always read your mind—especially when it comes to understanding the changes that come with age or shifts in your health. Tell your partner/s about it, whether you are old loves or brand-new to each other! You are the only person who can express the full truth of your body, mind, and sexuality. It’s not a gift to your partner to keep that to yourself!

Homework: If your relationship is fine but sex has become routine, switch it up. This isn’t a negative—this will bring you closer. Talk about what else you might like to explore: sex toys? erotic role-playing? There are so many erogenous zones, fantasies, costumes and erotic products that any couple of any age can find new things to try.

Get Good Help: Special pillows that aid in positions or holding sex toys, vibrators and lubricants can all be your helpers to staying vital. Vibrators can be the perfect assistant to a partner who is eager to please, pillows can alleviate strain or pain, and lubricant helps almost everything! Anything that gets you excited—from a cowboy hat to a black leather paddle—will bring arousal which leads to better sex.

Prioritize Sex, whether partnered or single: Orgasms, sensuality and/or arousal are good for you. They can improve mood and enhance health. If you are not partnered, we suggest that, instead of spending all your free time online searching dating services, dedicate some time to self-pleasure. Masturbate, and take time to learn more about your body and desires. If partnered, schedule time to be sensuous together, and see what happens. Sex therapist JoAnn Loulan points out that you can have wonderful sex without libido—just the willingness to explore erotic or sensual/intimate time with your partner can often lead to lovemaking.

Remember that Sex is More Than Intercourse: Touching all over is not just a delicious start to sex—it is sex. Oral sex isn’t just “foreplay”—it is sex. Don’t forget our earlier lessons about diverse experiences; nothing saddens us more than hearing that our elder friends stop having any kind of sexy pleasure in their lives because their body’s favorite thing isn’t what it used to be anymore.

Rev the Motor: Sometimes extra stimulation—a vibrator, for example—adds to the experience. For some midlife and older women, the heightened sensation helps get over the lowered sex drive that can be associated with menopause. Older men may also find that vibration adds to their sexual capabilities.

Order Some Appetizers: Have sex in order to have sex! Planning a date? Before your big date, masturbate or have a quickie jack-off, make-out, groping, or oral sex session with each other. This gets the juices flowing and is always a good pick-me-up! Even erotic love notes and sexts will do the trick for some.

Drop the Gavel: Whether it’s thinking you should only have sex the way you did at 25, or thinking, “I’m old now, no sex is inevitable,” recuse yourself from the judge’s bench! Staying open-minded and hopeful is likelier to lead to the best-for-you-in-your-situation sex.

Keep Your Allies Near: If you are LGBTQQ, stay up-to-date on your rights, be active in keeping and making friends your age, and keep the young’uns around you as well. Be perfectly clear in legal documents—wills, directives and contracts—as well as verbally with your “nearest of kin” about who you are going to grow old with, i.e., grow old having sex with!

Use It or Lose It: It’s not a very cheerful reminder, granted, but when sex therapists say that to older people, they are reminding them that any body function is more readily maintained when it’s exercised—whether it’s having sex or walking around the block. Whether via partner sex or masturbation, taking your pleasure parts out for a regular spin keeps blood flow—and the genitals themselves—healthy. Solo pleasuring helps focus you on erotic experience and an understanding of how changes in your body are manifesting. Take the changes of menopause and other effects of age seriously, but take your own sexuality seriously too; don’t just let erotic thoughts and feelings slip from your life. Read frisky books, watch movies with erotic plots, fantasize, talk with your friends about sex—keeping sex in and on your mind will help your body stay vitally sexual!





Common Myths about Sex and Age


Everyone has heard the phrase “dirty old man.” It’s often used as a kind of jokey reference to an older man’s expressing of sexual interest, but it’s never truly used respectfully, is it? Erotic movies featuring older women are called “granny porn” and often also ridicule aged bodies and the sexual behavior in which they can engage. We begin this section with these observations not because we agree with them—far from it! We simply want to remind readers of every age that if we want to enjoy eroticism, desire, sensuality, and loving touch in our older years, we will have to swim upstream against these attitudes. We’ll have to remind ourselves and our partners that we deserve all these pleasurable things, and we’ll have to guard ourselves against internalizing those elder-sex-negative messages.

There’s really just one primary myth about aging: Sex is for the young. Other myths, however, follow in its wake:

Most older people lose interest in sex.

FACT: Many people retain sexual interest and, if partner/s are available, maintain active sex lives throughout life.

There’s no reason to have sex once you cannot get pregnant.

FACT: Enjoyable sex can increase oxytocin and a sense of wellbeing and lead to orgasm, sensual pleasure, physical exercise, intimate connection, spiritual connection, stress release, hormonal balance, and much more at any time in an adult’s life.

Women are glad to be rid of sex after they hit menopause.

FACT: Many women feel sexually free because they are no longer worried about getting pregnant and/or feel liberated to explore sex in new ways.

Older people have a high rate of sexual dysfunction; women have a hard time having intercourse after menopause, while men have erectile problems.

FACT: These changes are part of many people’s aging process, but mostly in relationship to intercourse, not all sex—older people enjoy all kinds of erotic experience, just as younger people do. (And they are not by any means inevitable in an intercourse context, either; some older people continue to enjoy intercourse for decades, whether because they are taking advantage of erectile drugs and hormone replacement therapy or because they did not undergo any of the common physical changes other elders may experience.)

Once an older person has lost their spouse, sex is over.

FACT: People of all ages date and re-marry. Many stay sexually active for decades after the loss of a partner.

Elder sex is somehow shameful.

FACT: Bodies change shape and skin gets softer and doesn’t fit as tightly, but sexual pleasure can help keep older people active, engaged, and healthy. It’s the job of sex educators, media, outspoken seniors and their allies to change these ageist attitudes.

Maintaining a happy sex life into one’s later years is difficult or challenging for many people. It might be an illness or life circumstance that comes up much earlier in the lifespan and then is only complicated more by age. The death of a partner can change a person to such a degree that they won’t partner again. For some older people sexuality and desire remain important facets of life until the day they die, but this is not everyone’s experience, and, ironically, it can feel problematic to some seniors even to say so. “When we hear ‘rah rah rah, you can fuck unto death!’ it’s alienating,” says one older friend; she points out that not every senior has access to potential partners, that sexual response may have changed so much that it’s disappointing and provokes sadness or anger, that body image issues can definitely plague elders, and that there can be difficult-to-surmount barriers to a sexy old age.





Body Image



We can be gorgeous at thirty, charming at forty and irresistible at any age.

	—Coco Chanel





We’ve already pointed out that many of us have feelings about our bodies that affect our sexual comfort level. Society can be judgmental and we can internalize this, so part of the challenge—and its solution—of staying sexy as we age is the relationship we have with our bodies, as they were and as they are becoming. Weight gain, loss, or redistribution; silver in our hair or encroaching baldness; loss of muscle mass and softening, wrinkling skin; and, for some, surgical scars and even mastectomies or other bodily alterations can change the way we feel about ourselves so profoundly that we can’t look in a mirror or believe that our partner, especially a new flame, would want to see us in the light of day. Sometimes the reason older people turn away from partner sex—within a relationship or do not put themselves out there as single looking for a partner—has specifically to do with this issue.

But sex is not just the dance of two good-looking bodies, is it? It’s a way to connect with another person, share sensation and intimacy, a way to celebrate life and pleasure, a way to express love, and, for that matter, lust and “like,” and so much more. Sometimes concentrating on this is enough to help you if you are plagued by body image issues. If the other person is in bed with you, it surely counts as a plus! Sex in the dark or with our eyes closed is still sex, even though we admit we do have a bias for the light; genitals and other erogenous areas can still connect even if we jazz up our bodies with robes or sexy garments. It’s important to give each other positive reinforcement, and it’s also important to give this to yourself. If you let your mind race with negative messages, you must learn to overlay positive ones. If that is not enough to help you then we will go a step further: your partners are thrilled to see you nude, they are so happy to touch and enjoy your body and both of your bodies together. Everyone deserves this comfort and pleasure. Candlelight, whether artificial by a fake votive from a dollar store to a real candle, is your best friend, not to mention romantic. You only live once, and this is the last segment of your life; don’t let anything hold you back.

And by the way, let’s be clear, putting it the way we did in the last paragraph—that “sex is the dance of two good-looking bodies”—does not mean that we think bodies are not good-looking if they’re older, silver-haired, wrinkly, chubby, rail-thin, scarred, or all the other things a person with body image issues is convinced keeps them out of the ranks of people who are attractive enough to have sex. We are all attractive enough, and we all deserve pleasure. We don’t think sex has to be restricted to two people, either. But you already knew that.

Changes of life cannot be wished away. We can prioritize eating a healthy diet and exercise. Those two things do radically affect quality of life. Whether it’s figuring out how much exercise you can manage to add to your routine and choosing good foods to nourish yourself, or it’s cuddling with a partner or masturbating instead of having sex the way you did when you were 30, something is certainly better than nothing. Attitudes like, “Well, we all have to die someday,” or, “I can’t stick with this so I may as well give up,” or “You are never going to be sexy again with this old body,” will only make it harder to focus on the positive: what is working and all that you can do. Fight those hopeless thoughts with a daily mantra of “Something is better than nothing” and “I deserve health and pleasure.”

Remember: Pleasure Is Your Birthright, and that fact doesn’t have a sunset clause.





A letter from Shar about the Future of Sex


I sat down to write about the future of sex for our concluding chapter and I will tell you the end—since it’s the future, after all—before I tell you how the chapter starts. It ends with me asking you: What do you think the future of sex will be? How do you see your own sexual future? Do you feel changing values in society will have, or could have, an effect on your desire? If general society becomes empowered around sexuality does that affect you, your love life, your freedom of sexuality, your freedom from shame? If so, then how?

You’ve read this whole book. You have read our history and our advice, and Carol brought forth her wisdom, Good Vibrations’ wisdom, and what she and they have gathered along the way from all the customers, colleagues, and businesses that are in this special sex-positive family.

Even though more technology always lies in the future, it’s not distinctly the future of sex. Despite all the fabulous hi-tech vibes that perform better than ever, Good Vibrations still sells Smoothies and Magic Wands—after all these years. I bet you dimes to dollars those will be on the shelf in another forty years, even if they are sitting beside a hovercraft drone vibe! That’s no insult to how popular, best-selling or high-quality anything new is. My bet is they will exist side by side. Take a look around you—almost everyone has a smartphone these days where tons of information is literally at your fingertips, and yet events like Burning Man are popular with the tech crowd so they can get dusty, dirty, and free of the everyday world.

Look at the popularity of reality shows starring people surviving on deserted islands—yet this is at a time in human history when, because of satellite systems, a boat or plane being “lost at sea” is nearly an impossible fact to swallow. New technology is all about turning business as usual upside down, and we expect no less from our medicine, health, entertainment, and security—yet why are we stumped at times about what gives us pleasure? Or rather, why do we get stymied in thinking our pleasure isn’t as important as our health? There are devices on our wrists with apps to track our footsteps and calories, and even to track our Kegel exercises—these are shiny and new, then get folded into daily life—my barometer for this is my mom, who’s becoming an adopter!

Innovation, and the technology scientists need to support that innovation, affects the future of sex because it affects health, the length of life, quality of life, and birth control. STIs cured, vaccinations invented, hard-ons guaranteed and vaginas ready for action. People staying alive longer and learning how to be sexual, or deciding if they want to stay sexual at the same pace, at ages older than our ancestors even used to live.

Also, science is winning the battle against many diseases that were once death sentences. While it’s true that for every STI vaccination there is a new killer virus or a new mutation to an existing disease—for crying out loud, even lice have mutated!—the truth is that there are more and more survivors. Younger people think of popping a pill for an STI like they think of taking penicillin for an ear infection. Who knows what they’ll be able to cure next? We could possibly enter a time when you could have sex without worries again—like the 1970s! What would that feel like?

But I know the constant ebb and flow of life. A new cream is invented for menopausal pussy one day then government-mandated vaginal probes are debated in Congress the next. Could Benjamin Franklin have predicted that for the Senate floor?

Life is circular, not linear, so we can’t predict anything new. But we can manifest for change and we can wish for future generations something new and wonderful. All our work and efforts and blood, sweat, and tears will not be for naught.

Sex can be fun and pleasurable. The simple reality is we are sexual beings. Unfortunately, there are so many people who want to continue to make sex not pleasurable but dirty and shameful, a necessary bodily function only to be done in the dark. Procreation-only sex at home and secretly jerking off to “dirty” magazines in the bathroom, having secret affairs and unsafe sex will—I predict—never totally vanish, because history proves that hypocrisy never goes away. And following that train of thought we must admit that those folks are the ones who are vehement against others who are open and honest and transparent about their sex lives. I might be oversimplifying it to say I think it’s because they’re jealous. Please add “the end of sexual hypocrisy” to our Future of Sex To Do List.

History has also shown that common threads are threats of disease, psychological problems due to life experience, financial concerns, communication problems, biological problems, dogma, and even the law. As a species, we have adapted. Upon reflection, some folks might notice that it’s when they feel most positive about their lives or themselves that desire for sex is at its strongest—when they feel less empowered or more insecure, desire is lowest. Other people relate desire to freedom. Maybe that’s why they think of sexuality as being for younger people—because they felt freer when they were young. And yet others combine the two: If I am empowered or secure then I am feeling more freed up for exploration. We go through our daily lives and might not even notice the little things that police us. Or is that simply called being civilized? What affects your desire? And if we figure those things out, can we predict how fixing those things might shore up the future?

What I am happy to report is that in present time our society is addressing bullying, homophobia, transgender-phobia, domestic violence, date rape, rape, gender assumptions—what makes a man or a woman is up to each individual—as well as gender prejudice, like abortion rights and equal rights, in constant discourse—whether it is via social media, mainstream media, politics, or scientific journals. Thanks to social media we are in a hyper-connected world, and sharing information can be enlightening. In the past, a town’s community was dependent upon word being spread much more slowly, and only if the town crier or a newspaper deemed it appropriate. One community might make headway and another one not even know about the struggle. Nowadays memes on gender reversal are seen by my deer-hunting cousin in Arkansas just as easily as my vegan friend in Manhattan. Community values and standards are radically different, and local news and TV varies greatly all across our country. Nevertheless, access to things like Queer Vogue-ing is only a few strokes of the keyboard away.

Currently bullying is on the radar and out in the open, as well as girl’s empowerment. Fantastic. These issues are on many people’s minds and advice abounds. The younger generation is growing up with much of this as their daily life—they aren’t “fighting” it as much as they are integrating contemporary attitudes into the everyday school mindset and language—some of that is text language, mind you.

I have noticed the moral value of gender not being a crotch-check is becoming accepted as more people are informed about trans and gender identity.

Maybe the key to the future is access: greater access to information and education. The Internet has radically changed access. If you want to know about something, you can. You can find it. The worry is to be sure it’s accurate information, but even that concern is futuristic. Back in the day, someone could get bad information from a doctor or teacher or other “authority” and it would be hard to get a second opinion. Nowadays, you simply need not believe the first website or app you read.

I would like to see young people as equal partners approaching their adult sex lives by rolling around in bed, enjoying themselves, asking “does this feel good?”—“does this?”—laughing and exploring without shame. Not the whole focus being one partner, traditionally male, asking and all the power the other one holds (traditionally female) is to say yes or no. Instead, I want it simple—be on equal footing and approaching sex without stigma or slut-shaming. Learning together. What if? What if we didn’t feel stupid for not knowing? What if we felt safe and happy to explore and experiment? What if we all felt totally comfortable with lights on or going slowly?

One thing I know for sure is that no matter what time period it is, when it comes to relationships, partners must always remain communicative, be able to talk about and deal with the outside influences and fears that may exist affecting their relationship, and encourage each other as individuals.

In order to have those relationships, and for our own health and pleasure, I know that self-esteem, reasonable standards and boundaries are mandatory. I always say that everyone needs the sentence, “Nobody talks to me that way” in their vocabulary as well as, “Yes, please” and “More, more, more!” Creating a world where everyone has access to simple standards and self-esteem should be like falling off a log, but it isn’t. I ask that for the future.

I would hope that checked-in sex is a wave of the future and the result of all these current efforts. By checked-in I mean embodied and in your body—the opposite of checked-out sex. I know that we look forward to people becoming more communicative, confident and embodied during sex. I think checked-in sex is part and parcel of no-shame sex and the release of stigma.

Maybe the future of sex is the right to have sex with the lights on, feeling comfortable about your desire and your body and going slowly, and lots and lots of pleasure. That is our wish for you.

Nearly forty years ago Good Vibrations dreamed of a radical life where pleasure was your birthright. Maybe that is still the dream. Is it? It’s my dream, Carol’s dream, everyone at Good Vibrations’ dream for you. For your present and your future, and for all who desperately want to experience their authentic sexual selves or who aren’t brave enough to do it now but will be soon—or will one day. What do you think the future of sex will be? How do you see your own sexual future?

Endnotes




* * *



[i] Except when they’re not! Not every person gets erotic pleasure from any given “pleasure part” discussed in this section. And this may vary, too, according to cultural assumptions, class, regional cultures, and other influences and variables.

[ii] On Our Backs was the first women-run erotica magazine. Susie Bright served as Editor-in-Chief for its first six years, with Nan Kinney and Deborah Sundahl as publishers. The first issue came out in 1984; OOB defined the look and politics of lesbian culture for the 80s, as well as playing a definitive role in the feminist sex wars of the period.

[iii] Sexecology.org is Annie Sprinkle and Elizabeth Stephens’ website. Ecorotic® is a registered trademark of Good Vibrations.

[iv] Joani Blank wrote A Kid’s First Book About Sex for 4 to 8 year olds and The Playbook for Kids About Sex for school age children who could read and draw in its pages. Joani was fueled by a passion for creating content that previously hadn’t existed and to help change society’s views on sexual health and education so she founded her own publishing company and named it Down There Press. Starting in 1975 Joani Blank wrote and published the Playbook for Women About Sex, Good Vibrations: The New Complete Guide to Vibrators, Still Doing It: Women and Men Over Sixty Write About Their Sexuality, First Person Sexual: Women and Men Write About Self-Pleasuring, The Good Vibrations Guide: The G-Spot and the books of images I Am My Lover: Women Pleasure Themselves and Femalia.
