TO ALL

Well provided Hibernians.


Gentlemen,



S Nature hath been so very Indulgent to ye, as to stock your Gardens with Trees of the largest Growth, for which Reason ye are caress'd, whilst Men of less Parts, tho' in some Things more deserving, are laugh'd at, and excluded all Company.

As all Infants, especially of the Female Sex, are much delighted with Fruit, so as their Years and other Appetites increase, no Wonder if that increases too. Both Men and Beasts have some-thing or another, for which they are esteem'd; so ye being in a particular manner Happy in this Talent, may securely laugh, while ye daily grow in the Ladies Favour, and spread your Branches over all the Kingdom: Many a hopeful Stick of Wood has been produc'd by this glorious Tree, who after they had piss'd their Estates against the Wall (as the good Housewives term it) have by the Strength of true Hibernian Prowess rais'd themselves to the Favour of some fair Virtuoso, and being by her plac'd in a HOT-BED, have been restor'd to their pristine Strength, and flourish'd again; and like true Heroes, not envying the busy World, have been content to spend the remainder of their Days in an obscure Nook of the World.

Thus, Gentlemen, and as all Poets chuse the most Worthy to patronize their Works, I humbly offer ye the following Poem, and that you may still continue as ye now are; that your Trees may ever flourish, your Green-houses be secure, nor your young Plants be ever nipt in the Bud, and that you may ever stand against all Cracks, Storms, Tempests, and Eruptions,

Is the hearty Wishes of Your's,

BOTANICUS.

Natural H I S T O R Y


OF THE


T r e e of L I F E.




THE Tree of which I fain would sing,

If the kind Muse her Aid would bring,

Is Arbor Vitæ; but in brief,

By vulgar Men call'd—Tree of Life.



First for Description then, 'tis such

As needs must captivate you much.

In Stem most streight, of lovely Size,

With Head elate this Plant doth rise;

First bare—when it doth further shoot,

A Tuft of Moss keeps warm the Root:

No Lapland Muff has such a Fur,

No Skin so soft has any Cur;

This touch'd, alone the Heart can move,

Which Ladies more than Lap-dogs love;

From this erect springs up the Stalk,

No Power can stop, or ought can baulk;

On Top an Apex crowns the Tree,

As all Mankind may plainly see;

So shines a Filbeard, when the Shell,

Half gone, displays the ruby Peel

Or like a Cherry bright and gay,

Just red'ning in the Month of May.



As other Trees bear Fruit at Top,

And they who rob 'em must climb up;

This still more rare doth upward shoot,

But at the Bottom bears its Fruit,

And they who'd reap its Virtues strong,

Need but to lay 'em all along,

Ope' wide, their Mouths, and they'll receive

The Fruit of Life, and eat, and live:

Not the fair Tree that India bears,

All over Spice both Head and Ears,

Can boast more Gifts than the Great Pow'rs

Have granted to this Tree of ours:

That in good Ale its Power boasts,

And ours has Nutmeg's fit for Toasts

And Bags by Nature planted grow,

To keep 'em from all Winds that blow.



The Rise is slow, and by Degrees,

Both Fruits and Tree itself increase

So slow, that ten Years scarce produce

Six Inches good and fit for Use;

But fifteen ripen well the Fruit,

And add a viscous Balm into't;

Then rub'd, drops Tears as if 'twas greiv'd,

Which by a neighbouring Shrub's receiv'd;

As Men set Tubs to catch the Rain,

So does this Shrub its Juice retain,

Which 'cause it wears a colour'd Robe,

Is justly call'd the flow'ring Shrub.



In every Nation springs this Tree,

In some confin'd; in others more free;

In England, 'tis of mod'rate Size,

And oft' does nine full inches rise:

But Ireland, tho' in Soil most poor,

Exceeds all Lands in this fame Store;

And sent o'er hither, it is such

As does exceed our own by much,

And gets the Owner many a Farthing,

For Ladies love it in their Garden.



That it's a Tree right sensitive,

Denies no honest Man alive:

Tho' as one shrinks and will not stand,

This rises at a Lady's Hand,

And grows more strong the more 'tis strok'd,

As others fall when they are pok'd.



When nipping Cold bites off our Nose,

And hoary Frosts the Morn disclose,

In Hot-beds only then 'twill live,

And only when-well warm'd will thrive;

But when warm Summer does appear,

'Twill stand all brunts in open Air;

Tho' oft they're overcome with Heat,

And sink with Nurture too replete;

Then Birchen Twigs, if right apply'd

To Back, Fore-part, or either Side——

Support a while, and keep it up,

Tho' soon again the Plant will droop.



Motteux had one very untow'rd,

And thought to mend it with a Cord,

But kill'd the Tree, yet gain'd his End,

Which makes th' Experiment condemn'd.



Others have thought to mend the Root,

By taking from the Tree its Fruit;

But in the Nutmegs lies the Breed,

And when they're gone we lose the Seed;

Tho' Virtuosi still have don't,

And always found it yield Accompt;

For Hey——gg——r then buys the Wood,

And of it makes us Whistles good,

Which yearly from Italia sent,

Here answers his and our Intent.



Others too curious will innoc

Ulate their Plants on Medlars Stock,

(i.e. as Tongues in Vulgar pass,

They graft it on an Open-arse;)

But Gardeners, Virtuosi, all,

Say this is most unnatural.



That Soil is certainly the best,

Whence first it sprang, and first increast,

In Vallies hollow, soft, and warm,

With Hills to ward off every Storm,

Where Water salt runs trickling down,

And Tendrils lie o'er all the Ground,

Such as the Tree itself shoots forth,

And better if't be tow'rds the North;

When such a Piece of Ground you see,

If in the midst a Pit there be,

There plant it deep unto the Root,

And never fear——you'll soon have Fruit.



Tho' let young Botanists beware

Of Insects that oft' harbour there,

Which 'mongst the tender Fibres breed,

And if not kill'd, eat up the Seed:

Good Humphrey Bowen gives another,

(As each Man should assist his Brother)

That is, to take especial Care

Not to set Vulvaria near;

Of them two Sorts are frequent found,

One helps, and to'ther spoils the Ground;

And many a Plant thriving and tall,

Destroy'd by them, has got a Fall.



But Misan's taken this just napping,

And against all Things that can happen

Both to the Shrub and Tree, has told some

How to make the deadliest Wholesome;

These venomous Vulvaria grow

At Vaux-Hall and St. James's too;

Nay, and about the Tree so leap,

That very few good Plants can 'scape.





The Names and Virtues


Old Mother D'Acier, in her Notes

On Homer, some hard Greek Word quotes,

Calls it Nep, nep,—I know not what,

And says it is the very Plant that

The tawny Queen to Helen sent,

To cure her Griefs at all Event.



Great Milton's Murd'rer says it is

The fam'd Machæra Herculis,

And proves from some old Grecian Poet,

So plain that all Men sure must know it,

That of this Tree the Club was made,

With which he overcame ('tis said)

Thespius' Daughters, all grown wild,

And fifty Mad-Women made mild;

Which very Club—(it makes one Laugh)

Omphale turn'd into a Distaff.

Nay, the Hesperian Tree was this,

As shew the Poma Veneris;

These Apples doubtless were the Fruit

That 'twixt the Queens rais'd such Dispute,

To make 'em all stark-naked stand,

While Paris held it in his Hand,

And chuck'd it into Venus' Mouth,

'Cause she with Beauty fir'd the Youth.



The Virtues are of such great Note,

That twenty Volumes might be wrote;

The Juice alone Green-Sickness cures,

And purges thro' all corporal Pores;

If any Maid be sick, or faint

Of Love, or Father's close Constraint,

One Spoonfull of this Cordial Balm

Soon stops each Grief, and every Qualm;

'Tis true, they sometimes Tumours cause,

And in the Belly make strange Flaws,

But a few Moons will make 'em sound,

And safely fetch the Swelling down.



Not Saffron chears the Heart like this,

Nor can Champaign give such a Bliss:

When Wife and Husband do fall out,

And both remain in sullen pout,

This brings them to themselves again,

And fast unites the broken Chain;

Makes Feuds and Discords straightway cease

And gives at least a Night of Peace.



This Rarity may now be seen

In Lambeth, at a Garden Green,

Bowen his Name, who in high Tone,

Calls it the Tree of Silver Spoon,

Which all the Maids of curious Eyes

May there behold of largest Size.

THE


Natural H I S T O R Y


OF THE


T r e e of L I F E.


The DESCRIPTION and PLACE.




HE Tree of Life is a succulent Plant, consisting of one only strait stem, on the top of which is a Pistillum or Apex, at some times Glandiform and resembling a May-Cherry, tho' at others, more like the Nut of the Avellana or Filbeard-Tree.

Its fruits, contrary to most others, grow near the Root; they are usually no more than two in number, their bigness somewhat exceeding that of an ordinary Nutmeg both contained in one strong Siliqua, or purse; which, together with the whole root of the plant, is commonly thick set with numerous Fibrilla or capillary Tendrils.

The tree is of slow growth, and requires time to bring it to perfection, rarely seeding to any purpose before the fifteenth year; when the fruits coming to good maturity, yield a viscous Juice or balmy succus, which being from time to time discharged at the Pistillum is mostly bestow'd upon the open Calyx's of the Frutex Vulvaria or flow'ring Shrub usually spreading under the shade of this tree, and whose parts are by a wonderful mechanism adapted to receive it. The ingenious Mr. Richard Bradley is of opinion, the Frutex is hereby impregnated, and then first begins to bear; he therefore accounts this Succus the Farina foecundans of the plant: and the learned Leonhard Fucksius, in his Historia Stirpium insigniorum, observes the greatest sympathy between this tree and shrub, They are, says he, of the same genus, and do best in the same bed, the Vulvaria itself being indeed no other than a female Arbor Vitæ.

It is produced in most Countries, tho' it thrives more in some than others, where it also increases to a larger size. The height here in England rarely passes nine, or at the most, eleven inches, and that chiefly in Kent, whereas in Ireland, it comes to far greater dimensions, is so good, that many of the natives entirely subsist upon it, and when transplanted, have been sometimes known to raise good houses with single plants of this sort.

As the Irish soil is accounted the best, others are as remarkably bad for its cultivation; and the least and worst in the world are said to be about Harborough and the Forest of Sherard.

The stem seems to be of the sensitive tribe, tho' herein differing from the more common Sensitives; that whereas they are known to shrink and retire from even the gentlest touch of a Lady's hand, this rises on the contrary, and extends itself when it is so handled.

In winter it is not easy to raise these trees without a hot bed; but in warmer weather they stand well in the open air.

In the latter season they are subject to become weak and flaccid, and want support; for which purpose some gardeners have thought of splintering them up with birchen Twigs, which has seem'd of some service for the present, tho' the plants have very soon come to the same or a more drooping state than before.

The late ingenious Mr. Motteux thought of restoring a fine plant he had in this condition, by tying it up with a Tomex or cord made of the bark of the Vitex, or Hempen-Tree: but whether he made the ligature too straight, or that the nature of the Vitex is really in itself pernicious, he quite kill'd his plant thereby; which makes this universally condemn'd, as a dangerous experiment.

Some Virtuosi have thought of improving their trees for some purposes, by taking off the Nutmegs, which is however a bad way; they never seed after, and are good for little more than making whistles of, which are imported every year from Italy, and sell indeed at a good price.

Some other curious Gentlemen have endeavour'd to inoculate their plants on the stock of the Medlar and that with a manure of human Ordure, but this has never been approv'd; and I have known some tree brought to a very ill end by such management.

The natural soil is certainly the best for their propagation; and that is in hollow places, that are warm and near salt water, best known by their producing the same sort of Tendrils as are observ'd about the roots of the Arbor itself. Some cautions however are very necessary, especially to young Botanists; and first, to be very diligent in keeping their trees clean and neat; a pernicious sort of insect, not, unlike a Morpione or Cimex, being very subject to breed amongst the Fibrillæ, which, if not taken heed of, and timely destroy'd, proves often of very dangerous consequence.

Another caution, no less useful, we have from that excellent and judicious Botanist Mr. Humphrey Bowen, to beware of a poisonous species of Vulvaria, too often mistaken for the wholesome one, and which, if suffer'd too near our trees, will very greatly endanger their well-being. He tells us, in the 12th volume of his large abridgment of la Quintinye, that before he had acquir'd his judgment and experience, some of his plants have often been sufferers through this mistake; and he has seen a tall thriving tree, by the contact: only of this venomous shrub, become porrose, scabiose, and cover'd with fungous Excrescences not unlike the fruits of the Ficus sylvestris in which case the succus also has lost both its colour and vertue; and the tree itself has so much partaken of the nature of the venomous shrub that had hurt it, that itself has become venomous, and spread the poison through a whole Plantation.

These distempers of a tree of the greatest use and value, have employ'd the labours of the most eminent Botanists and Gardeners, to seek out remedies for them: In which, however, none have succeeded like the celebrated Dr. Misaubin who from his profound knowledge in Botany has composed a most elaborate work upon all the things that can happen, both to the Arbor Vitæ and Vulvaria also: There he has taught a certain cure for all these evils; and, what is most wonderful, has even found out a way of making the most venomous Vulvaria itself wholesome, which he practises daily, to the satisfaction of all that apply to him.

These venomous Vulvaria are but too common in most gardens about London; there are many in St. James's Park, and more in the celebrated gardens at Vaux-hall over the water.





The NAMES and VIRTUES.


Besides the common name of Arbor Vitæ, a very learned Philosopher and great Divine would have it call'd, Arbor Scientiæ boni & mali; believing, upon very good grounds, this is the tree which grew in the middle of the garden of Eden, and whose fruits were so alluring to our first mother. Others would have it call'd the Mandrake of Leah, persuaded it is the same whose juice made the before barren Rachel a joyful mother of children.

The learned Madame D'Acier in her notes upon Homer contends it should be called Nepenthes. She gives many reasons why it certainly is that very plant, whose fruits the Egyptian queen recommended to Helen, as a certain cure for pain and grief of all sorts, and which She ever after kept by her as her most precious jewel, and made use of as a Panacæa upon all occasions.

The great Dr. Bentley calls it more than once Machæra Herculis, having proved out of the fragments of a Greek Poet, that of this tree was made that club with which the hero is said to have overcome the fifty wild daughters of Thespius, but which Queen Omphale afterwards reduced to a distaff. Others have thought the celebrated Hesperian trees were of this sort; and the very name of Poma Veneris, frequently given by Authors to the fruits of this tree, is a sufficient proof these were really the Apples for which three Goddesses contended in so warm a manner, and to which the Queen of beauty had undoubtedly the strongest title.

The vertues are so many, a large volume might be wrote of them. The juice taken inwardly cures the green-sickness and other infirmities of the like sort, and is a true specific in most disorders of the fair sex. It indeed often causes tumours in the umbilical region; but even those being really of no ill consequence, disperse of themselves in a few Months.

It chears the heart, and exhilarates the mind, quiets jars, feuds and discontents, making the most churlish tempers surprizingly kind and loving. Nor have private persons only been the better for this reconciling vertue, but whole states and kingdoms, nay, the greatest empires in the world have often received the benefit of it; the most destructive wars have been ended, and the most friendly treaties been produced, by a right application of this universal medicine among the chief of the contending parties.

If any person is desirous to see this excellent and wonderful plant in good perfection, he may meet with it at the aforementioned Mr Bowen's garden at Lambeth, who calls it The Silver-Spoon Tree; and is at all times ready to oblige his friends with the sight of it.

THE


Ridotto al' Fresco,


A


P O E M.




What various Arts attempts the am'rous Swain,

To force the Fair, or her Consent to gain—

Now Balls, now Masquerades his Care employ,

And Play and Park alternately give Joy—

Industrious H——gg——r, whose magick Brains

Still in their Shell the Recipe retains

Like some good Midwife brings the Plot to light

And helps the lab'ring Swain to Celia's Sight;

For this his Eunuchs in high Buskins tread—

And chaunt harmonious Lays for this,—and Bread;

For this the Assembly's fix'd; and the huge Dome

Swells with the Lady's Vows, when the Stake's gone.—

For this he forms the vicious Masquerade,

Where Damsels may securely drive their Trade,

For which the Salesman, Chandler, Chairmen loudly pray,

And Pickpockets too, hail the joyful Day—



But now what Tongue can praise the mighty Worth,

Who to Ridotto gave an English Birth;

To him let every Templar bend the Knee,

Receive a Ticket, and give up the Fee:

Let Drury-Lane eternal Columns raise,

And every wanton Wife resound his Praise;

Let Courtiers with implicit Faith obey,

And to their grand Procurer Homage pay.



No more shall Duchesses to Bath repair,

Or fly to Tunbridge to procure an Heir;

Spring-Gardens can supply their every Want,

For here whate'er they ask the Swain wil grant,

And future Lords (if they'll confess the right)

Shall owe their Being to this blessed Night;

Hence future Wickedness shall take its Rise,

(For Masquerade to this is paultry Vice)

An Æra of new Crimes shall hence begin,

And H——gg——r chief Devil be of Sin;

No more shall Ugliness be his Disgrace,

His Head mends all the Frailties of his Face;

When Masques and Balls to their Conclusion drew,

To this his last Resort the Hero flew;

So by degrees the Errant Knights of old

To Glory rose, and by Degrees grew bold;

A while content the common Road they trod,

'Till some great Act at last confess the God.



Now Painters work,—and dine, that starv'd before,

And Tallymen supply each needy Whore—

Fam'd Covent-Garden droops with mournful Look,

Nor can St. James's her great Rival brook:

Each Duck and D——ss, quacks to different Tunes,

One claps her Wings for Love, the other swoons;

Each Vintner storms and swears he is undone,

Vollies of Oaths speak loud the Drawer's Moan;

Porter who us'd to search for needful Girls,

Now sucks his Fingers, or his Apron twirls,

Bemoans his Loss of Business, and with Sighs,

In Box imprison'd lays the useless Dice.



Spring-Garden now alone does all invite

The Cit, the Wit, the Rake, the Fool, the Knight:

No Lady, that can pawn her Coat or Gown,

Will rest 'till she has laid the Money down:

Each Clerk will to the Joints his Fingers work,

And Counsellors find out some modern Querk,

To raise the Guinea, and to see the Grot,

And 'mongst the Belles to slant it at Ridolt.



Here Seamstresses and Maids together vie,

And the spruce 'Prentice shines in Sword and Tye:

Bandy'd in Lace the City Dame appears,

Her Hair genteelly frizzled round her Ears;

Her Gown with Tyrian Dyes most richly stain'd,

Glitt'ring with Orient Pearl from Orphans gain'd.



My Lord, to oblige his Spouse, takes Tickets three,

Crys, one's for you my Love, and one for me,

The third dispose as you shall best adjudge,

Shew where you're pleas'd, and where you owe a Grudge:

Madam elate, thinks she'll be kind to Betty,

To hide the Slips she made with Spark i'th' City:

But Stallion Tom, who well knew how to scold,

And by his Mistress's Favour grown too bold,

Swears if he has it not, he will reveal,

And to his Master tell a dismal Tale;

Madam, reluctant, gives him up the Paper;

He at her Folly laughs, and cuts a Caper.



Sylvia, a Lady, kept by twenty Beaux,

Who never yet could brook the Marriage Noose,

By each a Ticket offer'd, scorns 'em all,

In hopes some Fool at last will Victim fall,

And, kindly offer Treat and Ticket too,

Which to her Charms she thinks most justly due;

At last a brisk young Templar full of Fire,

Whom Writs with Money, Wine with Love inspire,

Address'd the Dame, she yeilds his glowing Charms,

And for a Ticket flies into his Arms:



So every dapper Fop and brawny Rake

Will Tickets to their Ladies Presents make;

To Sin, the only certain Dedication,

To every gentle Mistress in the Nation,

From Suburb Whore, to ranting Dame of Fashion;

For none's so niece as to refuse the Suit,

But grasps the Tree tho' 'tis forbidden Fruit.



Near where the Thames in pleasant Windings runs,

Near where the famous Glass-house fiercely burns,

(Which to the Love of poor desponding Swains,

An Emblem terrible, but just retains.)

Near where fam'd Vaux was to have fled,

With lighted Match, soon as he'd done the Deed;

Whence some pretend to say by second Sight,

That it foreshew'd the Fate attends this Night,

'Cause here the Fair will many Matches light.



Spring-Gardens lie shaded with verdant Trees,

That nod their reverend Heads at every Breeze;

Embassadors like Turks hence send Express,

And Ministers of State like Devils dress—



Should some wild Indian see the various Scene,

He'd swear all Nations of the Earth do here convene,

And take for quite reverse this medley Farce,

Think Strumpers Saints, or catstick'd Beau a Mars.



But now the Dancers nimble Feet go round,

And with just Measures beat the passive Ground,

Each one inclines to different Delights—

Musick the Fair, Sweetmeats the Beau invite;

The Templar wisely does his Care enroll,

Pockets the Pheasant, and eats up the Fowls

Nor will return to join the giddy Rout,

'Till he has eat and drank his Guinea out.



Now Dancing fires the Nymph to softer Joys;

The Musick's dull, the Wine and Sweetmeat cloys;

Strephon streight takes the Hint, withdraws a-while,

By soft Endearments does her Grief beguile;

Soon they return more vig'rous than before,

Do what they will, she cannot be a Whore.



For Mahomet may dream of heavenly Stews,

Where Virgin Rose, soon as it's lost, renews,

And shake with every Breath of Air serene,

As trembling for the Rapes they've daily seen;

When if those past can shake their Height profound,

Ridotto sure will fell them to the Ground;

Here Art to Nature join'd makes it compleat,

And Pyramids and Trees together meet;

Statues amidst the thickest Grove arise,

And lofty Columns tow'ring to the Skies;

Then next an Obelisk its Shade displays,

And rustic Rockwork fills each empty Space;

Each joins to make it noble, and excells

Beaufets for Food, Grotto's for something else.



But hark! the Doors on jarring Hinges turn,

All enter in, and the blest Scene's begun;

A thousand Lights their livid Flames display,

Pour forth their Blaze, and form a mimick Day:

Sudden a motley Mixture fills the Place,

And Footmen shine as lordly as his Grace;

To see the sad Effect and Power of Change,

Ladies turn'd Men, in Breeches freely range:

Young smooth-chin'd Beaux turn Priests and Fryars,

And Nun's chaste Habits hide our Country 'Squires.

Belles, Beaux, and Sharpers here together play,

And Wives throw their good Spouses Wealth away;

And when their Cash runs low, and Fate runs cross,

They then Cornute 'em to retrieve their Loss.



Dice and Intrigue so mutually are blended,

That one begins as soon as t'other's ended:

A City Heiress blooming, rich, and fair,

Picks up the Cards and Counters with great Care;

Against her fate a smooth young Baron,

Wit he had none, Beauty he had his share on,

A soft clear Skin, a dapper Neck and Waist,

In all Things suited to the modern Taste;

And most polite, like all our modish Brood,

That is, a very Fool, who's very leud:

He ogles Miss, she squints, and turns aside,

Nor can her Mask her rising Blushes hide;

At last (as Bargains here are quickly made)

She yeilds to be Caress'd, tho' still afraid;

She cries, a private Room's for them most fit,

For Reputation is the Glory of a Cit;

This only is the Place, where in a Trice,

Some Angel steals the Wounds of friendly Vice;

The Nymph finds a Relief for all her Pains,

And the lost Maidenhead's restor'd again.



But who is he in Bower close confin'd,

With a kind Fair t' unbend his troubled Mind,

Sure by his Air, his Beauty, and his Grace,

It Phoebus is, or some of heavenly Race.



A petty Courtier, of small Estate and Sense,

Stood hearkning by, and cry'd it was the P——ce.



Your Pardon, Sir, I knew it not before,

For my Mistake depended on his Whore,

One had Latona to'ther has L——r.



Next to the Grotto let us bend our Eye,

The Grotto, Patron of Iniquity,

Speak O ye Trees with kind refreshing Shade,

How many Whores have at your Roots been made;

Alas; how small the Number to what now,

This one, this happy Night, alone will shew

So many, that each conscious Dryad flees,

Lest she too should be ravish'd thro' the Trees.



Next rattling Dice invite th' attentive Ear,

Lords loudly laugh, as loud the Bullies swear:

The Country Knight o'th' Shire sells his Estate,

And here with Heart intrepid meets his Fate;

So they withdrew to quench their glowing Flame,

And to preserve the Honour of her Name;

For oh! sad Fate as they ascend the Stairs,

At the Room Door her good Mamma appears,

Soon as she spies her Child with Looks demure,

She charges her to keep her Vessel pure:

Miss pertly answers to avoid her Doom,

Mamma, whose Hat and Wig is in the Room?

The good old Dame yeilds at the just Reproach,

Cries—Well my Dear, don't take too much!



Thus various Joys soon waste the fleeting Night,

And Sleep and Lust the Croud to Bed invite;

Some in their Truckle-Beds to snore all Day,

Others in Gambols with their Wh——es to play;

The Dunghill Trapes, trickt up like virtuous Trull,

If by good Chance, she gets a Dupe or Cull;

On Tallyman intrudes twelve Hours more,

And for a clean Shift presumes to run a Score.



Sages may say, that Arts and Science fail,

And Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale:

In England they have given new Arts a Rise,

And what in Science wants, increase in Vice,

And to be great as Angels when they fell,

(If not exceed) at least they equal Hell.

electronic works



1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.



1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

works. See paragraph 1.E below.



1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the

collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.



1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in

a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

States.

1.F.



1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.





Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm



Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from

people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To

SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

particular state visit http://pglaf.org



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate





Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

works.



Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project

Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.





Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.

unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.





Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:



http://www.gutenberg.net



This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
